It's second nature to walk home
Before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles
When there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here

Sick intuition that they taught us

So we won't freak out

We hide our figures

Doing anything to shut them out

We smile, a way to ease the tension

So it don't go south

But there's nothing funny now



When will we stop saying things

'Cause they're all listening

No, the kids ain't alright

Oh, and they do what they see

'Cause it's all on T.V

Oh, the kids ain't alright



Boys will be, boys will be

Boys will be, boys will be boys

But girls will be women

Boys will be, boys will be

Boys will be, boys will be boys

But girls will be women



I'm sure if there's something

That I can't find the words to say

I know that there will be a man

Around to save the day

And that was sarcasm

In case you needed it mansplained

I should've stuck to ballet



When will we stop saying things

'Cause they're all listening

No, the kids ain't alright

Oh, and they do what they see

'Cause it's all on T.V

Oh, the kids ain't alright



Boys will be, boys will be

Boys will be, boys will be boys

But girls will be women

Boys will be, boys will be

Boys will be, boys will be boys

But girls will be women



If you're offended by this song

You're clearly doing something wrong

If you're offended by this song

Then you're probably saying

Boys will be, boys will be

Boys will be, boys will be boys

But girls will be women



When will we stop saying things

'Cause they're all listening

No, the kids ain't alright

Oh, and they do what they see

'Cause it's all on T.V

Oh, the kids ain't alright



Boys will be, boys will be

Boys will be, boys will be boys

But girls will be women

Boys will be, boys will be

Boys will be, boys will be boys

But girls will be women
