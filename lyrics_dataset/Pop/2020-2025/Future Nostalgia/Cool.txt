Guess I never had a love like this
Hit me harder than I ever expected
We been up all goddamn night, all night, all night
Keep it going 'till we see the sunlight
And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice

You know, you know, you know

Baby I could see us in the real life

You know, you know, you got



Got me losing all my cool

'Cause I'm burning up on you

In control of what I do

And I love the way you move

Got the heat and the thrill

Give you more than any pill

Never running out of juice

When its only me and you

You got me, you got me losing all my cool

I guess we're ready for the summer



I like us better when we're intertwined

The way you touch me got me losing my senses

Put your love with your lips on mine, on mine, on mine

You got me working up an appetite, tite



And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice

You know, you know, you know

Baby I could see us in the real life

You know, you know, you got



Got me losing all my cool

'Cause I'm burning up on you

In control of what I do

And I love the way you move

We got the heat and the thrill

Give you more than any pill

Never running out of juice

When its only me and you

You got me, you got me losing all my cool

I guess we're ready for the summer

You got me, you got me losing all my cool

I guess we're ready for the summer



Skin tight

I'll show you heaven, there's nothing better

I'll give it to you

All night

You know, you know, you know



Got me losing all my cool

Yeah, you like the way I move

In control of what I do

And my love makes you brand new



Got me losing all my cool

'Cause I'm burning up on you

In control of what I do

And I love the way you move

Got the heat and the thrill

Give you more than any pill

Never running out of juice

When its only me and you

When its only me and you



(Hey, aye, yuh)



I guess we're ready for the summer

You got me, you got me losing all my cool

I guess we're ready for the summer

You got me, you got me losing all my cool
