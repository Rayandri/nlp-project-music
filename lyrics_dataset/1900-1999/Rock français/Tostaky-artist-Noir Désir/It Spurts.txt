Nobody, I'll drag me into this
stinking thoughts I know you
you won't never carry it off
even if you're kind with me
get out leave me alone

and have a nice day asshole



I know why you're a pretty cynic shit

that I can't stand anymore

so sorry about that but

I feel like you pick on me boy



get out leave me alone

and have a nice day asshole

listen and see

don't try it with me (3)

I told you



well you been drinking a lot

and your head's going around

of course you think I'm a

paranoiac silly dirty wicked boy

and you're a pain in my aah



so come on

stop

I fuck you

shut up

I'll kill you

fuck off

you always drive me crazy



get out leave me alone

and have a nice day asshole

listen and see

don't try it with me (3)

I told you

you don't even know anything true

about my life



poison

explodes

and spurts out of our souls
