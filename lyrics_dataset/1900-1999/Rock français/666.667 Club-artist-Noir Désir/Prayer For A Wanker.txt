I can swim, let's dive again
into another screen
I could scream but the silence
is the best scene
I can print, this picture won't tell you
what I mean

A prayer for a wanker

I guess it's enough

I'm sure it's enough

Just a prayer for a wanker

A prayer for a wanker

A prayer for a wanker

I can swear, someday we'll take this other way

let me crawl up to any big wide road

But I want to be sure

Yeah I wanna be pure

And I carry on with an inner storm

And it's blank around

I could stop now

But it's another dream my friend
