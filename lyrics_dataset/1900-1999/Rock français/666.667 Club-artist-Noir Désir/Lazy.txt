I can see you're young and pretty
I know it would be so easy
Any way dark lady I feel lazy
Those afternoons are confused
I don't think that you really chose
There's even one more reason to feel lazy



While you go away

While you go away

While you go away

While you go away



I could die but I could lie

I can deal with what's in your mind

Anyway, I'm tired and I feel lazy

You know we're both lost in maze

You're miserable, I'm so dazed

Don't you think you should feel



Suddenly lazy

lazy

lazy



While you go away

While you go away

While you go away

While you go away



Lazy, la, la, la, lazy

Lazy, la, la, la, lazy

Lazy, la, la, la, lazy



While you go away

While you go away

While you go away
