Should we ride along?
We make it sound so easy
Got something to hide why
Things are different now
We want to have it all

Should we find it easy?

Can't escape the need to know

What the future holds

Waiting for the stars to align

Waiting for the stars to align

Waiting for the stars to align

Waiting for the stars to align

Looking over my shoulder

This is really new to me

Try to picture what's coming

Maybe I don't want this to be

It's feeling much closer

Even if I'm afraid to see

Can't escape the need to know

What the future holds

Waiting for the stars to align

Waiting for the stars to align

Waiting for the stars to align

Waiting for the stars to align

Waiting for the stars to align

Waiting for the stars to align
