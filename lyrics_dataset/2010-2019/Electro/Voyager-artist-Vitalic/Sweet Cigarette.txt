Pull you out
With my fingertips
Take you just
Between my lips
Light you up
You start to glow

Smoking hot

I can't say no

Sweet cigarettes

Sweet cigarettes

Sweet cigarettes

Sweet cigarettes

I suck you in

I blow you out

To my burning love

I am devote

The rush of Nicotine

Like Liquid velveteen

I'm always in the mood

For a long slim and smooth

Sweet cigarettes

Sweet cigarettes

Sweet cigarettes

Sweet cigarettes

Just one puff

is never enough

Bring you to my lips

Watch the small eclipse

Suck it in

And blow it out

Watch it burn

And stubt it out
