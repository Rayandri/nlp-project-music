If you don't use it, you'll lose it
I feel myself slept away
There's no abuse, so don't confuse it
I don't want help, I just need space
If you can't feel it, you don't need it

They call it faith, I call it hate

It might be real, but I don't believe it

Am I depressed? Is it to late?

If you don't use it, you'll lose it

I feel myself slept away

There's no abuse, so don't confuse it

I don't want help, I just need space

It's so, it's so hard

To get to heaven

It's so, it's so hard

Don't make me bleed

Shine on, shine above

I don't believe it

The devil wants to know

He's teasing me

It's so, it's so hard

It's so, it's so hard
