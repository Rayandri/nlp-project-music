Hans is driving 
Behind the wheel and my pillow
Leaving the dream, high and low
Snow falling through the window
Hans is reaching on the radio

Sleeping pill, I´m in limbo

Sofa-surfing after show

Time to kill dancing disco



Sleeping pill

I´m in limbo

I´m in limbo

Oh I´m in limbo



Dancing disco

Dancing disco



Hans is reaching on the radio

Behind the wheel and my pillow

Leaving the dream, high and low

Snow falling through the window



Hans is reaching on the radio

Sleeping pill, I´m in limbo

Sofa-surfing after show

Time to kill dancing disco
