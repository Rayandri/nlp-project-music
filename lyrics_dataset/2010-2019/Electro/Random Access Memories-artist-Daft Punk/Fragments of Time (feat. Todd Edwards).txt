[Verse 1]
Driving this road down to paradise,
Letting the sunlight into my eyes
Our only plan is to improvise
[Build]

And it's crystal clear that I don't ever want it to end

If I had my way, I would never leave

Keep holding these random memories

Turning our days into melodies

But since I can't stay...



[Chorus]

I'll just keep playing back

These fragments of time

Everywhere I go, this moment'll shine

I'll just keep playing back

These fragments of time

Everywhere I go, this moment'll shine



[Verse 2]

Familiar faces I've never seen

Living the gold and the silver dream

Making me feel like I'm 17



[Build]

And it's crystal clear that I don't ever want it to end

If I had my way, I would never leave

Keep holding these random memories

Turning our days into melodies

But since I can't stay...



[Chorus]



[Chorus 2]

I'll just keep playing back

These fragments of time

Everywhere I go, this moment will shine

I'll just keep playing back

These fragments of time

This moment'll shine
