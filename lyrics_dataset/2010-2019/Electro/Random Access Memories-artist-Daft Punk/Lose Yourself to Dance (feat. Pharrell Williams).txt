[Verse]
I know you don't get chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping
You take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat

[Chorus]

Lose yourself to dance



[Verse]

I know you don't get chance to take a break this often

I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping

You take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the

Sweat, sweat, sweat



[Chorus]

Lose yourself to dance (Come on)



[Bridge]

Everybody dancing on the floor

Can't do any more anymore

Everybody on the floor

Yeah, come on



[Verse]

I know you don't get chance to take a break this often

I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping

You take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the

Sweat, sweat, sweat



[Chorus]

Lose yourself to dance (Come on)



[Bridge]

Everybody dancing on the floor

Can't do any more anymore

Everybody on the floor

Yeah, come on
