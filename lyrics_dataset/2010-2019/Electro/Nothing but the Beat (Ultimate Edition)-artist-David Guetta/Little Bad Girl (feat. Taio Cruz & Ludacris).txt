Oh yeah they tell me I'm a bad boy
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing over there

Look at her go on the dance floor

She's amazing, on the dance floor

When she moves, girl I want more

Keep it going girl like I got an encore

You got me saying

Go little bad girl, little bad girl

Go little bad girl, little bad girl

Go little bad girl, little bad girl

Oh yeah they tell me I'm a bad boy,

All the ladies look at me and act coy

I just like to put my hands up in the air

I want that girl dancing over there

Shaking her ass from the left to the right

Moving it round just the way that I like

I wanna see it moving like a movie on flight

You got it how I wanted and I want it all night

Look at her go on the dance floor

She's amazing, on the dance floor

When she moves, girl I want more

Keep it going girl like I got an encore

You got me saying

Go little bad girl, little bad girl

Go little bad girl, little bad girl

Go little bad girl, little bad girl

Go little bad girl, little bad girl

Go little bad girl, little bad girl

Go little bad girl, little bad girl

Let's go

She got my heart jumpin'

And my adrenaline pumpin' and gunnin'

Like ain't nobody ever seen

As a matter of fact I've seen 

This woman all up in my dreams

Whippin' and flippin' and stackin' and slappin'

I'm attacking after she back it up 

And make it drop

After I met her I tell her

DAVID GUETTA is on the track baby girl don't stop

Keep it going you never know

When somebody gonna throw couple dollars

Got a pocket full of hundred bills ludacris

Mr. make a woman holla

And every night on the floor

Puttin on a show

Everybody in the club here'a little something

You should know

Look at her go on the dancefloor

She's amazing on the dancefloor

When she moves, girl i want more

Keep it going girl like I got an encore

You got me sayin'

Go little bad girl, little bad girl

Go little bad girl, little bad girl

Go little bad girl, little bad girl

Go little bad girl, little bad girl

Go little bad girl, little bad girl

Go little bad girl, little bad girl

Go little bad girl, little bad girl
