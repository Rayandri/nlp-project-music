Where you've been
Where you've been all my life
Baby this is it
The way you looking me like
Cause I'll be it
That I want something from you

You know what?

What I wanna do, do, do

Every touch, it would bring me to life

I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like

Oh, everytime, it would bring me to life

I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like

What it'd be like, what it'd be like...

Saw you from afar

All say, what's up

You can tell me your name, where we're waking up

Then call me, don't ya, I'm good, I'm gucci

Now you can kiss old ring goodbye, smooches

You're a beast, you're a beauty

Now I think somebody didn't get a bit of usage, shoot me

You're a firework, riding in the dark

So let's turn off the lights

And give me the spark

Every touch, it would bring me to life

I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like

Oh, everytime, it would bring me to life

I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like

What it'd be like, what it'd be like...

I want your love

Why can't you feel free

I want you feel free
