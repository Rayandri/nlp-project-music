S*T*A*R that's what you are
Cause you're big in Japan
You're big in Japan
S*T*A*R that's what you are
Cause you're big in Japan
You're big in Japan

I got a phone call

From across the hall

People knocking on doors

I fell asleep on the floor

I think I'll be fine

I feel totally 90's

As I'm lying on the ground

In my smoking undies

Keep my head down

Look away from the flash

I got a planet full of people saying I got a smash

Me I don't mind

Cause it's all for the fans

And the next thing you know I'm big in Japan

S*T*A*R that's what you are

Cause you're big in Japan

You're big in Japan

S*T*A*R that's what you are

Cause you're big in Japan

You're big in Japan

Big in Japan, big in Japan

Big in Japan, big in Japan

Now you know I gotta run

Got a shark on my back

I got a 10 ton agent wanna hear my tracks

This is gonna work, this is amazing

We could take it to the world with a perfect timing

If you don't know how you could do it like David

He's so hot right now he's a pretty big deal

Cut a manager in to come up with a plan

And the next thing you know I'm big in Japan

Big in Japan, big in Japan

Keep my head down

Look away from the flash

I got a planet full of people saying I got a smash

Me I don't mind

Cause it's all for the fans

And the next thing you know I'm big in Japan

S*T*A*R that's what you are

Cause you're big in Japan

You're big in Japan

S*T*A*R that's what you are

Cause you're big in Japan

You're big in Japan

S*T*A*R that's what you are

Cause you're big in Japan

You're big in Japan

S*T*A*R that's what you are

Cause you're big in Japan

You're big in Japan

Big in Japan, big in Japan

Big in Japan, big in Japan

Run, run gotta gotta run run run big in Japan, big in Japan 

Run, run gotta gotta run run run big in Japan, big in Japan 

S*T*A*R that's what you are

Cause you're big in Japan

You're big in Japan

S*T*A*R that's what you are

Cause you're big in Japan

You're big in Japan
