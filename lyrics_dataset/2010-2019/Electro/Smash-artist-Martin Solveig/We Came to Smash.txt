You clap your hands
You're turning heads
You're jumping ship
Jumping on my bed
It's knocking to my room
Dance away the night

I turned off my light x2

So watch me baby

Follow my lead

They can't stop us now

Take what you need

We came to smash it all

What we gotta lose

In a black tuxedo and shiny shoes

We came to smash, smash

We came to smaaaash

We came to smash, smash

We came to smaaaash

We , came , to , smash ... x3

Smash x4

Oouhhh , in a black tux x2

We came to smash you , Smash 

Oouhhh

We came to smaaaash

In a black tux

We came to smash you , Smash 

Oouhhh , In a black tuxedo

It's not too late

I sware it's not

He seems asleep

This guy is pocket dialing

Park up the car

In the parking lot

Let's take a ride

To my vacation spot

The streets are full

Fuck it we'll walk

Come on the phone

If you wanna talk

It gon no bars

It's dark in here

I only shine

So I can disappear

We came to smash, smash

We came to smaaaash

We came to smash, smash

We came to smaaaash

We , came , to , smash ... x3

Smash x4

Oouhhh , in a black tux x2

We came to smash you , Smash 

Oouhhh

We came to smaaaash

In a black tux

We came to smash you , Smash 

Oouhhh , In a black tuxedo
