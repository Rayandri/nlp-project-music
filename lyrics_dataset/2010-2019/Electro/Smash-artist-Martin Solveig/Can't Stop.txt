We're not gonna change the world
We're gonna rock it
Can't stop, entertain that's what its all about
We'll Sleep some other time, we're on a roll yeah
Can't Stop, Is this all you wanna give us now?



We're gonna drop the bomb

We're gonna blow up

Can't Stop, turning it out, shake it out now

Don't need no cred, Oh my god super rad



We Have your attention

Finger licking good

Everybody Listening

Cause they know they should.

We're not gonna change the world

We're gonna rock it

Can't stop, entertain that's what its all about

We'll Sleep some other time, we're on a roll yeah



Can't stop, is this all you wanna give us now?



Can't Stop

We're gonna drop the bomb

We're gonna blow up

Can't Stop, turning it out, shake it out now

Don't need no cred, Oh my god super rad



Can't stop, is this all you wanna give us now?



We're not gonna change the world

We're gonna rock it

Some other time, we're on a roll yeah

Is this all you wanna give us now?

(Overlapping)



We have your attention, finger licking good

Everybody listening, cause they know they should.



Is this all you wanna give us now?



We're not gonna change the world

We're gonna rock it

Can't stop, entertain that's what its all about

We'll Sleep some other time, we're on a roll yeah



Can't stop, is this all you wanna give us now?



Can't Stop

We're gonna drop the bomb

We're gonna blow up

Can't Stop, turning it out, shake it out now

Don't need no cred, Oh my god super rad



Can't stop, is this all you wanna give us now? x3
