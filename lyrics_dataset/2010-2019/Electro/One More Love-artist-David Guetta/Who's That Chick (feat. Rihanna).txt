(Feat. Rihanna)
Feel the adrenaline moving under my skin
It's an addiction such an eruption
Sound is my remedy feeding me energy
Music is all I need.

Baby, I just wanna dance

I don't really care I just wanna dance

I don't really care... care... care (feel it in the air... yeah)


She's been a crazy dita disco diva... and you wonder:

"Who's that chick? who's that chick?"

Too cold for you to keep her

Too hot for you to leave her

Who's that chick? who's that chick?

Who's that chick? who's that chick?

Who's that chick? who's that chick?

Back on the dancefloor better not to take me home

Bass kicking so hot blazing through my beating heart

French kissing on the floor, heart is beating hardcore

Heard everybody is getting a little sexy on the crazy juice

This will end up in the news

Baby, I just wanna dance

I don't really care I just wanna dance

I don't really care... care... care (feel it in the air... yeah

My heart is a dancer beating like a disco drum

Beating like a disco drum... beating like a disco drum...
