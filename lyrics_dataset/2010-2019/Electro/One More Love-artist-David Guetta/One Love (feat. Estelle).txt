hurt but but everyone gets weak someone to rely on that`s
what i really need
Now here we stay its all that were worth i`ve been thru the pain

and been dragged thru the dirt whatever they tell you were

bigger than words i`ve been where your standing i know how it

hurts let this be a song now and this be a day and we stand together well be okay

Because were survivors were making it work expecting

the best when they hope for the worst
