I've been fragile for a long time
A big old hole inside my heart
And I was searching through the valley
Stumbled on love in the dark
Was afraid to try but afraid to never know

What it feels like to be loved

Had a hill to climb

but the places we could go

Oh, I gotta know

So if we ever, fell in love

Would the wind know, would the pain go, oh

So if we ever, fell in love

Oh, oh, oh

I was empty it was all gone

The birds would sing but made no sound

Till I met you, found I was all wrong

You picked me up right off the ground

Was afraid to try, and afraid i'd fall again

crashing down from the sky, you know

Had a hill to climb, but with you I my heart will mend

That's the one thing, we all wanna know

So if we ever, fell in love

Would the wind blow, would the pain go, oh

So if we ever fell in love

Oh, oh, oh

I just wanna know, I just wanna know

tell me tell me so, baby I just wanna know

(repeat x3)

So if we ever fell in love

would the wind know, would the pain go, oh

(yeah) so if we ever fell in love

Oh, oh, oh

So if we ever fell in love

oh, I wanna know what it feels like to be loved
