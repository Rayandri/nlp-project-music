(feat. Will.I.Am)
I wanna go to Ibiza (Let's Go)
I wanna go to Argentina (Let's Go)
Yeah...I wanna go and dance (Dance)
I wanna dance in Paris, France (Let's Go)

I wanna go around the world (Let's Go)

and party with the girls (Let's Go)

and when I get there, when I get there, when i'm there I wanna go!



I wanna go crazy! I wanna go...

I wanna go crazy! I wanna go...

I wanna go crazy! I wanna go...

I wanna go crazy! that's where I wanna go...

I wanna go crazy! yeah I wanna go there...

I wanna go crazy! with you girl...



I need a go, need a fuckin' go

I wanna go, go, now go

I need to go, need a fuckin' go

Go celebrate life with a suicide girl (Girl)

I wanna go crazy! Crazy in the US of A...

I wanna go crazy! Crazy in the USSR...

Girl I get there, when i'm there I wanna go!

Where I wanna go ain't geographical

You cant google map, map-quest it when I go loco

If you need to know the designational I'm going crazy

I ain't by myself I'm coming with a whole bunch of ladies

Celebrating life to the max, girls are suicidal

In the club sippin' bottle after bottle after bottle

Celebration never stoppin'

Situation club hoppin'

Simulation panty droppin'

Penetration coochie poppin'

then am out!



I need to go back to Mars...

We about to take off...



In...

I wanna go crazy! I wanna go I wanna go...

I wanna go crazy! Thats where I wanna go...

I wanna go crazy! Thats where I wanna go...

I wanna go crazy! With you girl with you...

I wanna go crazy! With you girl with you...

I wanna go crazy! That where I wanna go...



I wanna go crazy with you!
