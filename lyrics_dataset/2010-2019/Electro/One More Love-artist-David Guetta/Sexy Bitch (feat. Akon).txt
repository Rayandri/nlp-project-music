Yes I can see her,
cause every girl here wanna be her.
Oh she's a diva, 
I feel the same, I wanna meet her.

They say she low down,

It's just a rumor and I don't believe it,

They say she needs to slow down,

The baddest thing around town.

She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen before,

nothing you can compare to your neighborhood (hood),

I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl,

Without being disrepectful.

The way that body moving I can't take it no more,

I have to stop what I'm doing so I can pull up close,

I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl,

Without being disrepectful.

Damn Girl !

Damn Yours's a sexy cheek, a sexy cheek,

Damn Yours's a sexy ,cheek damn girl !

Damn Yours's a sexy cheek, a sexy cheek,

Damn Yours's a sexy cheek, damn girl !
