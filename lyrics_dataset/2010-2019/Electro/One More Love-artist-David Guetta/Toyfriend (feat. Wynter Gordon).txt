(feat. Wynter Gordon) 
See you looking
Yeah, you looking over my way
I wanna leash you up
And put you into my cage

Teach you how to touch me baby

How to say my name

Bet you never had nobody to give It to you this way



I wanna put you in my closet

I wanna play till I'm exhausted

Come come baby come be my Toyfriend let me play with you

Come come baby come be my

Toyfriend till I'm through with you



Let me play with you

Let me play with you

Let me play with you

Let me play with you

BOUNCE!



Ain't got to dress you up

And put you on display

Rather keep you in my back house

I TURN YOU ON TURN YOU ON

IN SO MANY WAYS

AND I DON'T EVER HAVE TO USE NO BATTERIES!



I wanna put you in my closet

I wanna play till I'm exhausted

Come come baby come be my Toyfriend

let me play with you

Come come baby come be my

Toyfriend till I'm through with you

BOUNCE!



Let me play

Let me play

Let me play

Let me play

Let me play

BOUNCE!



Come come baby come be my Toyfriend

let me play with you

Come come baby come be my

Toyfriend till I'm through with you



Let me play with you

Let me play with you

Let me play with you

Let me play with you



Come come baby come be my Toyfriend let me play with you

Come come baby come be my

Toyfriend till I'm through with you
