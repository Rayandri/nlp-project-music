Ahhh....YEAH!
Ah, Ah yeah
Choose you wanna make me choose
You got to show me something now
Why I should be with you ?!

You wanna make me choose(x4)



Not easily impressed NO!

Not settling for less NO!

You want me to say yes OH WELL!

You better bring your best NO!



Help me make up me mind AH!

Prove that you're worth my time

Give me a reason why it should be

With you tonight..baby.



Make me believe it's all you

No matter what they all do

Don't want to play no games

I won't tease you and it won't stall you

But don't you think it's all you?

If you want SEX than it's all you!

And NO I don't want your number

And NO I don't want to call you



You want to make me choose

You got to show me something now

Why I should be with you ?! You wanna make me choose(X4)



Make me believe it's all you

No matter what they all do

Don't want to play no games

I won't tease you and it won't stall you

But don't you think it's all you?

If you want SEX than it's all you!

And NO I don't want your number

And NO I don't want to call you



2x:

Choose you wanna make me choose

You got to show me something now

Why I should be with you ?!



You wanna make me choose (X4)
