Have you f*** up from the last time?
You think you got everyone figured out
We are leavin' in a glass house
Cause everything is shadowing all around
Now tell me what you mad about
I'm tired of developing nonsense

And if you were to leave me now

I probably do nothing to stop it

I won't be missing you anymore!

Missing you anymore!

Missing you anymore!

Missing you anymore!

Missing you anymore!

Touch you little more!

Not love you anymore!

Is that what you really want?

Is that what you really want?

Have you f*** up from the last time?

You think you got everyone figured out

We are leavin' in a glass house

Cause everything is shadowing all around

Now tell me what you mad about

I'm tired of developing nonsense

And if you were to leave me now

I probably do nothing to stop it

Missing you anymore!

Missing you anymore!

Missing you anymore!

Missing you anymore!

Touch you little more!

Not love you anymore!

Is that what you really want?

Is that what you really want?

Now you can go spin your game girl

Go-go-go on with your game girl

Now you can go spin your game girl

Go-go-go on with your game girl

Have you f*** up from the last time?

You think you got everyone figured out

We are leavin' in a glass house

Cause everything is shadowing all around

Now tell me what you mad about

I'm tired of developing nonsense
