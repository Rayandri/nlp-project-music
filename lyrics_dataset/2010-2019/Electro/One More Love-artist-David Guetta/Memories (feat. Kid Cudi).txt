All the crazy shit i did tonight
Those will be the best memories
I just wanna let it go for the night
That would be the best therapy for me
All the crazy shit i did tonight

Those will be the best memories

I just wanna let it go for the night

That would be the best therapy for me

hey,hey

yeah,yeah...

All the crazy shit i did tonight

Those will be the best memories

I just wanna let it go for the night

That would be the best therapy for me

All the crazy shit i did tonight

Those will be the best memories

I just wanna let it go for the night

That would be the best therapy for me

hey,hey

yeah,yeah (x5)

It's getting late but I don't mind (x8)

hey,hey

yeah,yeah (x5)
