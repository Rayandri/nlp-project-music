Late at night
I lose my focus
Late at night
I'm calling out for you
It can't be right i got no focus
I hope you noticed

The chemistry

Is off the radar

Look at me

I don't know what to do

This chemistry

Is off the radar

You better let me see you later

Over and over you run in my mind

Give me one look and you know I'm fine

Can't you see we're only wasting our time

Baby thought you understood

It's the way you look... me

It's the way you move... me

And the way you touch... me

It's the way you love... me

What's the point?

I can't remember

Where's the key?

Well give it up to me

You got me boy

And i surrender

Let's get you back to my agender

Over and over you run in my mind

Give me one look and you know I'm fine

Can't you see we're only wasting our time

Baby thought you understood

It's the way you look... me

It's the way you move... me

And the way you touch... me

It's the way you love... me

Baby it's simple to see (baby it's simple)

This is where I'm meant to be (this is where I'm meant to be)

You stole a piece of my heart (you stole a piece of my heart, baby)

Making me start from the start (you're making me, you're making me start all over)

It's the way you love... me

And the way you move... me, me

(... me, me, me, me, me, me, me)

It's the way you look... me (it's love me)

It's the way you move... me (it's love me)

And the way you touch... me (it's love me)

It's the way you love... me (it's love me)

It's the way you look

Every little thing you do

Everything that you do

You can put me in the mood

You put me in the mood

Now I'm looking straight at you

You're looking at me too

Yeah you know what i want from you
