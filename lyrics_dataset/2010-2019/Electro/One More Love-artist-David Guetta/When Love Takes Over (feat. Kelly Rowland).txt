It's complicated... it always is,
That's just the way it goes.
Feels like I've waited so long for this,
I wonder if it shows.
Head under water, now I can't breathe,
It never felt so good.

'Cause I can feel it coming over me,

I wouldn't stop it if I could.

When love takes over, yeah,

You know you can't deny.

When love takes over, yeah,

'Cause something's here tonight.

Give me a reason... I gotta know,

Do you feel it too?

Can't you see me here on overload,

And this time I blame you.

Mmmm lookin' out for you to hold my hand,

Feels like I could fall.

Now love me right like I know you can,

We could loose it all.

When love takes over, yeah,

You know you can't deny.

When love takes over, yeah,

'Cause something's here tonight.

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

And I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I will be loving you all the time... it's true

'Cause I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I love the way you make me cry... I do

When love takes over

When love takes over

When love takes over

When love takes over

When love takes over

When love takes over

When love takes over

Over... over... over... over... over...

over... over... over, over, over

When love takes over, yeah,

You know you can't deny.

When love takes over, yeah,

'Cause something's here tonight.
