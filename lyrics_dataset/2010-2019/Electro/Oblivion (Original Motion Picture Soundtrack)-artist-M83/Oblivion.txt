Since I was young, I knew I'd find you
But our love was a song, sung by a dying swan
And in the night, you hear me calling, you hear me calling
And in your dreams, you see me falling, falling

Breathe in the light, I'll stay here in the shadows

Waiting for a sign, as the tide grows

Higher, and higher, and higher



And when the nights are long

All the stars recall

Your goodbye

Your goodbye



And in the night, you hear me calling, you hear me calling

And in your dreams, you see me falling, falling



And in the night, you hear me calling, you hear me calling

And in your dreams, you see me falling, falling



Breathe in the light, and say goodbye

Breathe in the light, and say goodbye
