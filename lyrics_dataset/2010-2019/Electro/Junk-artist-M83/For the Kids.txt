Where are you now?
Who do you go to?
For a shoulder to cry on
I hope that some day
You might turn around
And come back home



Where are you now?

When will I see your face again?

No matter how far apart we become

You know that I'll still hear your song



This is the day, this is our day mom

If we believe it, it will happen

I am everywhere, you remember?

I am in the water on the mirror

The strange flower you saw in the forest

And the morning dust tickling your neck

I am the wind mommy

And the wind is never sad

He's brave and strong, and furious at times

Soon I'll be strong enough to make you fly away

And nothing could ever stop us then



I don't know when I'll see you again

But I know that my love will last for eternity

I'll wait 'til the stars go dark for you

To come back to me
