I was driving at the dawn
But everywhere I go, everywhere I go I see you
Calling love to the land
Â‘Cause anything I do, anything I do
Is about you

I was searching at the speed of sound

And I go up and down until I hit the ground

I need someone



To forget about you

Now you get me

Just another soul to break

Evil is God and I'm going straight to Hell
