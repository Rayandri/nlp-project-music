Gonna break it, break it, break it, break it down for you, once more

When the sun goes down
And your eyes cannot see
When the sun goes down
And your hands cannot reach

When your bones feel like breaking

And your heart cannot take another run

I'll be there when the sun goes down



All that I want Is just to be crazy when the sun goes down

And all that I need is for you to be my baby

When the sun goes down



When the sun goes down



When the sun goes down

We'll be dancing in the dark

When the sun goes down

To the beating of your heart

As the Earth moves in orbit

I will always be the one

Who stands my ground

I'll be there when the sun goes down



All that I want Is just to be crazy when the sun goes down

And all that I need is for you to be my baby

When the sun goes down



All that I want Is just to be crazy when the sun goes down

And all that I need is for you to be my baby

When the sun goes down



When the sun goes down

When the sun goes down

When the sun goes down, I see you around
