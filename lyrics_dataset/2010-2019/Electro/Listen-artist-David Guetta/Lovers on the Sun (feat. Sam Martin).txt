Let's light it up, let's light it up
Until our hearts catch fire
Then show the world a burning light
That never shined so bright
We'll find a way, we'll find a way
To keep the cold night

From breaking in over the walls

Onto the wild side

The hunger satisfied



We're burnin' up

We might as well be lovers on the sun

We might as well be lovers on the sun

We might as well be lovers on the sun



We'll never know, we'll never know

What stands behind the door

But I got a feeling

It's a feeling that's worth dying for

Just close your eyes, and hold your breath

Because it feels right

We'll keep it moving untill we make it to the other side

And let's enjoy the ride



We're burnin' up

We might as well be lovers on the sun

We might as well be lovers on the sun

We might as well be lovers on the sun



Let's light it up, let's light it up

Until our hearts catch fire

Then show the world a burning light

That never shined so bright
