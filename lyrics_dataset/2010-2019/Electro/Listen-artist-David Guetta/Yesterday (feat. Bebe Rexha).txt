Black cars, black days
Rain drops on my window pane
Street lights, street life
Hot blood burning in my veins
History won't drag me down
I said no no no, I said no no no

It's buried 6 feet under ground

Let it go go go, let it go

Hey, hey, what you say?

I got no use for yesterday

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love right now

And if tomorrow never comes

I'm gonna stay forever young

These lungs of mine were made to scream and shout

I said hey, hey, what you say?

It sits on trouble all the way

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love right now

You're singing oh oh oh oh

I said hey, hey, what you say?

I got no use for yesterday

I got no, I got no

I got no use for yesterday

I got no, I got no, I got no use for yesterday 

Tonight I've got a new life

I gotta get right and get it moving

White lies left me snowblind

But now this time, I see right through it

History won't drag me down

I said no no no, I said no no no

It's buried 6 feet under ground

Let it go go go, let it go

Hey, hey, what you say?

I got no use for yesterday

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love right now

And if tomorrow never comes

I'm gonna stay forever young

These lungs of mine were made to scream and shout

I said hey, hey, what you say?

It sits on trouble all the way

I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love right now

You're singing oh oh oh oh

I said hey, hey, what you say?

I got no use for yesterday

I got no, I got no

I got no use for yesterday

I got no, I got no, I got no use for yesterday
