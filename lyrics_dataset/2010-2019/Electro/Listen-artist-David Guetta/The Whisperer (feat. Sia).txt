I was standing on the edge
I'd long for a new beginning
But I couldn't look down, but I couldn't look down
I'm a coward
A million voices scream in my head
And I felt sure that I would give in

So why couldn't I now, why couldn't I now

Your voice was louder



By design, God gave me feelings

And by design they shall not kill

But when the noises overwhelm me

I feel sure that they will

Oh, liberation, comes in whatever form to save me

I am burdened

And then the whisper comes

Your whisper in the breeze

Your whisper's what I'm needing



Quiet bursts

So to hurt

The whisperer



And though I struggle through the days now

It helps to know that you are listening

So I just wait it out 

I'll wait this out, by the hour



But by the design God gave me feelings

And by the design they shall not count

But when the noises over run me

I felt sure the day will

Oh, liberation, comes in whatever form to save me

I am burdened

And then the whisper comes

Your whisper in the breeze

Your whisper's what I'm needing



Quiet words,

soothe the hurt

whisperer
