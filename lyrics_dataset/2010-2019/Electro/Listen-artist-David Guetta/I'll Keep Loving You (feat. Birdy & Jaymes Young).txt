I've know from the start
You would break my heart
You are cruel, you are
But I'll keep loving you

I want you to know, 

I'm not perfect so, 

I'm a rolling stone 

But I'll keep loving you

For the rest of my life, I promise that I, I'll keep loving you

Oh.. I'll stand by your side, 

and I promise that I'll keep loving you.

I know you can't see,

I'm not what you need,

My spirit's free

But I'll keep loving you

You are so wild

You've a restless mind

I won't renounce

Why I'll keep loving you

For the rest of my life, I promise that I, I'll keep loving you

Oh.. I'll stand by your side, 

and I promise that I'll keep loving you.

I'm only a man 

I'll give you my love

But I make mistakes cause it's in my blood. 

The world is so full

Of flaws and of rules

But I promise that I will loving for you.

For the rest of my life, I promise that I, I'll keep loving you

Oh.. I'll stand by your side, 

and I promise that I'll keep loving you.
