Talking loud, talking crazy
Love me outside
Pray for the rain to come
Don't dry again
Guess it's true what they say
I'm always late

Say you need a little space

I'm in your way

It hurts, but I remember every scar

And I've learned

But living is the hardest part

I can't believe what I did for love

I can't believe what I did for us

Passionately burning to flames

Stitch myself up, then I do it again

I can't believe what I did for love

What I did for love

What I did for love

What I did for

What I did for love

What I did for love

What I did for love

What I did for

What I did for love

What I did for love

I'm a fool for your games

But I always play

Can't admit it was a waste

It's too much escape

It hurts, but I remember every scar

And I've learned

But living is the hardest part

I can't believe what I did for love

I can't believe what I did for us

Passionately burning to flames

Stitch myself up, then I do it again

I can't believe what I did for love

What I did for love

What I did for love

What I did for

What I did for love

What I did for love

What I did for love

What I did for

I can't believe what I did for love
