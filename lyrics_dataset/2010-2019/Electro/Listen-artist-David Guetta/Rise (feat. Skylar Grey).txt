You can take a swing at my ego,
you can make a run for my crown.
Even with an army of people
you ain't gonna take us down.
You can aim your evil right at us,

you can drop your bombs on the ground.

Even if your stand makes me nervous,

you ain't gonna take us down.



There'll be no need for crying

if darkness fills the skies.

We'll go on forever like the phoenix

we will rise up from the ashes.

This world is ours tonight

We'll go on forever like the phoenix

We will rise. We will rise.



You can take a swing at my ego,

you can make a run for my crown.

Even with an army of people

you ain't gonna take us down. No!



You can aim your evil right at us,

you can drop your bombs on the ground.

Even if your stand makes me nervous,

you ain't gonna take us down.



There'll be no need for crying

if darkness fills the skies.

We'll go on forever like the phoenix

we will rise up from the ashes.

This world is ours tonight

We'll go on forever like the phoenix

we will rise. We will rise.
