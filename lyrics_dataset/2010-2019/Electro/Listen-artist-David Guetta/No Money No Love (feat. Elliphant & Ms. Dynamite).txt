Born in this world
I say it's no money no love
No money no love
Yeah yeah yeah
In case you will no hear it again
It's no money no love

No money no love

Yeah yeah yeah

As soon as you let me know as the world is in my fever

Watch me while I disappear

No money no love

I get my heart scarred

From all my sins

Was my payback to never feel all again

Do you see the scars bruising my skin

Oh I wish I could erase them and start all over again

Maybe I should get down on my knees and I'll still be forgiven

For what I've done

Born in this world

I say it's no money no love

No money no love

Yeah yeah yeah

In case you will no hear it again

It's no money no love

No money no love

Yeah yeah yeah

It's sure you love me now as the world is in my fever

Watch me while I disappear

No money no love

Who do I call When the world is closing in

Is it too late for me to be there?

I give my last to be loved again

I cross my arms and clap for night

Can you say this dealer, have some mercy

Maybe I should get down on my knees and I'll still be forgiven

For what I've done

Born in this world

I say it's no money no love

No money no love

Yeah yeah yeah

In case you will no hear it again

It's no money no love

No money no love

Yeah yeah yeah

It's sure you love me now as the world is in my fever

Watch me while I disappear

No money no love
