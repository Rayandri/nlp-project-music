Baby I love you less and less
Because of what you've done to me
Baby I love you less and less
Because of what you've done to me
Le ciel se couche

Sur ta peau de louve

Les oies sont rouges

Ta mémoire est trouble

On a vu l'Espagne

Les rires et les larmes

L'amour a ses failles

Et ses curs nomades

Baby I love you less and less

Because of what you've done to me

Baby I love you less and less

Because of what you've done to me

I need your soul

Baby just don't let me go

I'll be your soul

Baby just don't let me go

Se promettre ma douce

L'Enfer et ses sources

Où les vipères rousses

Se meuvent en eaux troubles

Je deviens sauvage

Mon torse se décharne

Pour que Paris s'enflamme

De nos retrouvailles

Baby I love you less and less

Because of what you've done to me

Baby I love you less and less

Because of what you've done to me

Baby I love you less and less

Because of what you've done to me

Baby I love you less and less

Because of what you've done to me

We used to be, we used to be

We used to be, we used to be very happy

What lies all night

You made me feel so alive

Now all that there is

The sweet souvenir

I walked down on the river

I put my feet in the water

I remember, I remember

We used to come here together

I need your soul

Baby just don't let me go

I need your soul

Baby just don't let me go

Baby I love you less and less

Because of what you've done to me

Baby I love you less and less

Because of what you've done to me
