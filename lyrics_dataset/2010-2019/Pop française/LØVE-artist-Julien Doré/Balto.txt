Goodbye Blato
I'm missing you dog
Theses are sorrow, 
Crying you're gone
I come with you 
To find a new home

I come with you 

Because I'm alone

With the sun on my hair

With the moon on your tongue

Because life is unfair

Goodbye Blato

I'm missing you dog

Theses are sorrow, 

Crying you're gone

I come with you 

To find a new home

Because I'l alone

Goodbye Blato

I'm missing you dog

Theses are sorrow, 

Crying you're gone

I come with you 

To find a new home

Because I'm alone

Because life is unfair

With the sun on my hair

With the moon on your tongue

Because life is unfair

With the sun on my hair

With ??? on your tongue

Because life is unfair

With the sun on my hair

With the moon on your tongue

Because life is unfair

Without you without her

And we'll find a new home

Because life is unfair

I come with you

To find a new home

Because I'm alone
