I am a better man. 
But I've been really bad. 
Are you a betta man ? Well I am. 
You 've got a stereo, a boosta video 
You cannot understand. Well I can. 

No song for guanoz, a song for the Men 

Goddam', you're too young to understand. 

I'm the big papa teaching straight to your brain. 

The old schoold Rocka remains the same. 

We play on stringa wood a single colored blues. 

But you don't give a damn' yo my friend 

We kick the tambourine without a compu-plug-in.

You're not a supa fan, well I AM.

This is mystirious, this is the beat of the boss.

( I don't know what I'm talking about, yo my friend ) 

I know te gusta la chica, y nada mas boy .

No puedes follar la guapa sin papa. musica.

No song for guanoz, a song for the men.

Goddam', you're too young to understand. 

I'm the big papa teaching straight to your brain.

The old schoold Rocka remains the same. 

I am a better man.

But I've been really bad.

Are you a betta man ? Well I am.

You 've got a stereo, a boosta video. 

You cannot understand. Well I can.

No song for guanoz, a song for the Men. 

Goddam', you're too young to understand. 

I'm the big papa teaching straight to your brain. 

The old schoold Rocka remains the same.

Once again I've got a beat on my brain lika bang bang poisoning my head. 

Lika need a pen to describe the pain but it ain't the same.
