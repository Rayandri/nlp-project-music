Chicken!
Dance, lika in supa trance, Nance, nada consequence
Don't you care about what the popular say
Don't you give a funk they' re not like you and may, So passé

Shine and dance, you my supa trans, Shark, crawling in the dark

Take a look around, these skeletons are damned

They have made their time so fuck them anyway

Yopa hey ohh !

Pumpin' the jam or caught in bad romance.

Like a litta Gozee, I like to prance

You are my hero : muscle gogo

I've got the growing sticky-mojo

I've got a pill stamping into my head

I'm dancing dead

Shine, sparkling multi lightz, Oh my, am I still alive?

Don't you realise I'm losing da control?

Losing da control is nada fun at all ... not at all

Pumpin' the jam or caught in bad romance

Like a litta Gozee, I like to prance

I've lost my biga dancing gogo

Oh no mo' stick growin' ain't got no mo'

I've got a pill stamping into my head

I'm dancing dead

Ain't got no brain, God 'ain't got no amo, playing my head on chimo-casino

Russian roulette fok' my motorette

Silly litta thing you got no fluid livin' in

You 'got no vida in the fluid cauz you had a bad deal

Yes you had a bad deal con da pill

So no mo' drug o' be my friend a dancing dead

Ain't got no brain, God 'ain't got no amo, playing my head on chimo-casino

Russian roulette fok' my motorette

Silly litta thing you got no fluid livin' in

You 'got no vida in the fluid cauz you had a bad deal

Yes you had a bad deal con da pill

So no mo' drug o' be my friend a dancing dead (x3)

So no mo' drug o' be my friend a dancing dead ...
