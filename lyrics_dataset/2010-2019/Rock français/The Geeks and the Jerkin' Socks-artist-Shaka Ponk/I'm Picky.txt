Hey man, it's not gonna work
It has nothing to do with you 
I'm sorry, it's me, the thing is : I'm Picky !
I'm Picky and all the girls I drive them crazy
I drive them crazy cos I'm sexy

They call me sexy cos I'm hot, catch my knot

Don't you know I am so hot cos I am picky

And everything is in the lack

The lack of me into you thing makes you scream my name

Honey Holy Hole, that's the goal

To make you wonder why I'm cold and distant

I'm "cold and distant" yes I am

I'm Picky cos I'm all alone

You know that it's crimi, yes it's criminal..



REFRAIN

I'm Picky cos I'm all alone

Maybe I'm alone cos I'm a picky one

I got a lotta girls waiting for me not to call

Another Sunday morning on my own 

Maybe I'm too good for you

Or maybe you don't know me cos you know nada 

I got a lotta comics to read on the throne

Good looking you and I could get along



Oh Porque, porque siempre dices lo mismo

Lo mismo shiza shy I am, Bim Bam Bam

I fall down and shame again on me

Cos you are laughly with your friends

about my weirdo comportamiento

I'm Picky yo, freaky no dating

modelo and woman consistent and too persistant

I'm cold and distant 

Remember me all the girls I drive'em crazy

I drive'em crazy cos I'm lazy, I don't give a damn,

You know I'm fuckin' lazy, I don't give a damn



REFRAIN



Hey, Hey, Hey...

Talk to me, walk with me, Talk to me, Walk with me, Talk to me, Walk with me, Talk to me you're picky !



I'm Picky, I drive them all crazy

I drive them all crazy,

You know that i'm HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT



I'm Picky cos I'm all alone

Oh maybe I'm alone cos I'm a picky one

I got a lotta girls waiting for me not to call

Another Sunday morning on my own
