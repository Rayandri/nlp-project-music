Un, dos, tres, go!
once upon a time i had a man
once upon a boring night i was single again
some may say i'm supa picky girl
from another world

but i found my pearl



you got me rising like a star

you make my day

like who you are

you changed my vision of all the sudden

i'd pick a guy like you, for everyone



so loopylicious

you're sweet and vicious

you make me feel feel feel like a real killa brunette localicious



tiny loosers begin' on their knees

tryin' to be sexy, crying "baby baby please..."

other melo-manic point of view

baby i've got through 'cauz i found you



you got me rising like a star

you make my day

like who you are

you changed my vision of all the sudden

i'd pick a guy like you, for everyone



so loopylicious

you're sweet and vicious

you make me feel feel feel like a real killa brunette localicious



so karmalicious

you're cute and vicious

you make me feel feel feel

mighty real real real...



frah:



hey donchaknow

i don't like the man with the flowers

i don't like the boring café

i'm not into romantic lovers



i wish every girl know you baby



hey donchaknow

i like ta play

come closer now

come closer and kick me again and again and again.....



you got me rising like a star

you make my day

like who you are

you changed my vision of all the sudden

i'd pick a guy like you, for everyone



so loopylicious

you're sweet and vicious

you make me feel feel feel like a real killa brunette localicious

you make me feel feel feel like a real killa brunette localicious
