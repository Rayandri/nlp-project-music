I've got a boyfriend, a kinda supermale,
The kind a man u gotta get into ya bed
I've got a girlfriend, the kindo supa belle,
the kind a girl ' the whole world wanna bang
We are wired my lova sista, U got me, my lova bro' I' got ya
I wanna be a bouncing bouncing ball, In love I'm gonna fall, gonna fall lika sex ball

I ve got a boyfriend, a kind'o' supermale,

the kind a man u gotta get into your bed

We are wired my loca sista, You got me, my loco bro' I got ya

I've got a girlfriend, a loopy girlfriend,

The kind a girl ' the whole world's lovin'

I'm tired of minimum-bubble-gum-sex-planz

I'm gonna fall, gonna fall lika sex ball

A 3-some-multi-fun-he-she, dirty deeds

Oh bad seeds ! Doncha tell your mom about our multi -fun-X-some

We are dirty kids

The bad seeds wanna dance dance dance

I've got a girlfriend, the kindo supa belle,

the kind a girl who's coming hard in your hand

I ve got a boyfriend, a kind'o' supaman,

the kind a man u gotta get into your head

We're gettin higher we're gettin higher ,

You got me, my loco bro' I've got ya

I have a feeling ' we're not really doing what we were told to do

I can imagine my dady screaming at me 'cause I came down on you

It's kindo' gross, it's kindo' gross, a kinda bueno- the kinder-loss

A silver cross on a naked breast is such a mess, such a mess, such a fucked up mess hey ...
