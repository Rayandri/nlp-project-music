Yeah Ooooh!
Yeah Ooooh!
Lie on the floor, do you want som' mor' ?
The guy is gone, you're left alone
Don't be a fool It's not "so cool"
The guy is gone, you've got to move on

U gotta pack up your stuff

Caus no one is so tough

No one can freeze on memories

You betta run run, I think u betta run pretty baby

you betta run run, I think u betta run pretty baby

You walk again ? Love you my friend !

You fucked the blues ? Great fuckin' news !

I don't like that "Goz", a new friend of yours

He's not your type, He's gonna be bad

He's gonna make it repeating

Scratch on your skin and your skin is so thin, thin

thinner than u think.

You betta run run, I think u betta run pretty baby

you betta run run, I think u betta run pretty baby

You've got a gun, gun

What's up with the gun, a little horny hey ?

You've lost again, my lonely friend, your sister soul

You learn again ' about the men ' you have no control

This is the story repeating, tears on your skin

and i try once again not to take it on the chin

I cannot do more, and I know for sure

that you and me it's real now u know what I feel

We betta gum gum, honey betta gum together honey !!

Yeah Ooooh! (x8)
