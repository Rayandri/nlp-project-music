If one day you come for cry
I think that i'll want you
If one day.. maybe one night
So they'll choose
Bring the smile we used to cry

This smile is all for you

Then we have to play the game

And to let it go again



Just dreaming of paris at night



I think that i should remain high



If one day you come for cry

I think that i'll want you

If one day.. maybe one night

So they'll choose



Bring the smile we used to cry

Christmas is all for you

Then we have to play the game

And to let it go again



Just dreaming of paris at night



I think that i should remain high



If one day you come for cry

I think that i'll want you

If one day.. maybe one night

So they'll choose



Bring the smile we used to cry

This smile is all for you

Then we have to play the game

And to let it go again



Just dreaming at paris at night



Just dreaming at paris at night



I think that i should remain high



with you
