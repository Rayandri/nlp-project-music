Hey would you?
hey would you?
Hey would you be mine?
Sing a little lullaby
you know i need you
you could paint my mind in blue



But i can't see you smiling



you know i'll be there again

to tear out of you old pains 

For now it looks like you don't know

The Things you don't wan't to show



But i can't see you smiling



We coul go anywhere you want to go

you see those places where ....(?)

I don't want to hear you calling

Your mother, your father and your ?

But i can't see you smiling
