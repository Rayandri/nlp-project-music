The road will be narrow till the moon get yellow 
bag of lies will have no use,
Say the people already choose
sharpen your arrow if you want wake up tomorrow
ready fi trouble we gonna struggle nation them a say so

Resistance, everyone a know now government a lie

I see the slope and I say so babylon a run down

see the stone is rolling and rolling

Resistance, everyone a know now president a lie

I see the storm and I say so, a change is coming

War you a talking enemies you wanna find

so tell me whats the meaning

of the rules that you define for we

if you wan fight then

you should work hard on your rythmes

cause disyah time no one a blind

we said a crime remain a crime

You are a no good mister bossman

no badda try to get our child

drowning to the shallows

no badda try to fool our eyes

your light is a shadow we know

Living no proper, but you no matter

cant feed the anger we a suffer by a dropper

you say messiah but you are liar

try a remember why you captain on this boat ya

Resistance, everyone a know now government a lie

I see the slope and I say so babylon a run down

see the stone is rolling and rolling

Resistance, everyone a know now president a lie

I see the storm and I say so, a change is coming

Do you believe

do you believe in love

man a wear it in the struggle like my boxing gloves

do you believe

do you believe in love

Mister officer its time now remember your role

if you can't protect the people you should step outta me road

cause revolution is just a rolling like a stone

ina your town and all around we come fi run over the crown

Resistance, everyone a know now government a lie

I see the slope and I say so babylon a run down

see the stone is rolling and rolling

Resistance, everyone a know now president a lie

I see the storm and I say so, a change is coming
