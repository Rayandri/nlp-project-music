Now we a give thanks for being alive 
cause that feeling alright is a present from above
nah cry aagain better day a gwan
now we a give thnaks for being alive
cause that feeling alright is a blessing from above
nah cry again

you nah easy walk, nah easy talk

nah easy enjoy down deh ya

stop from stick a dem tell-lie-vision,

bredda don't you konw we need more ambition

they said, affi hustle for daily bread

but keep your eyes open we cannot be blind a the game

never let them rob you again

put you troubles and you worries away

preserve your mind for a brighter day

inspiration, meditation

man affi know how to give your own celebration

we got thousand reasons

now we a give thanks for being alive

cause that feeling alright is a present from above

nah cry again better day a gwan

now we a give thanks for being alive

cause that feeling alright is a blessing from above

nah cry again

whatch again there is a thing inside

into rivers mountains and oceans

if you nah feel tell me who gonna feel it for you

who gonna make you uprise

ina this mad world full a lies

the wise eye ago see the real flower blossom out

if you nah see tell me how can you see you through

who gonna open your eyes

affi build your destiny, your own direction

make things happen in your life and be broad

affi take a big slice, hurry up le bredda

disyah life is too short and the end never warm

violence away, make you love be the answer

try learn your way before looking for antoher

me say watch up out there, away from your corner

how the people them living on

Now we a give thanks for being alive

cause that feeling alright is a present from above

nah cry again better day a gwan

now we a give thanks for being alive

cause that feeling alright is a blessing from above

nah cry again
