Some a dem a still come front me door
Say them come again say they want friend but they want more
Some a them said real knocking at my door
Could nah wait no longer that, sure of that me nah like those
Bad speech inna your back with handful of rose ya 
reality me nah go loose until me reach for nuff a dem a lie nuff a dem imposter 

They want chase me, they come fi lock me they wanna put me on the ground 

Them never know me got the lion in me fi all my friends and my enemy 

Me boss the same energy with truth deeper inna me and 

Yes, I man is from the dust a who a link up to the ground 

Me say no one can curse cause real roots dem above and the love we got a 

Could heal the one who got a lack a love so 

Them nah like we, words we a say 

Real talk man a use, speaking up the truth make the fool confused

God bless my way everyday

Please turn me loose, I say come turn me loose

Words them a weapon if them sharp like a knife

Could hurt a man or rise a next youth to life yes 

Give it to the wise man him go calm down a strife

But if ignorance rule the biz we go see war become rife 

I choose to keep them flying over them row 

Let's word be your wing dem man haffi reveal what's the winds claim 

I know you could keep flying ova deh so 

Even if I know dem ago condemn 

Can you really live with the deaf them 

Them nah like we, words we a say 

Real talk man a use, speaking up the truth make the fool confused

God bless my way everyday

Please turn me loose, I say come turn me loose

Some a dem a still come front me door

Say them come again say they want friend but they want more

Some a them said real knocking at my door

Every youth a run fi experience dem haffi get 

Me go so back in a the days fi tell dem no me nah forget 

I say O.G. time to watch what you're saying 

A lot a song gave the people another sight 

Then a lot a reggae djs gonna fit a lit a mind 

We say conscious

We say daily what people them chant 

Them nah like we, words we a say 

Real talk man a use, speaking up the truth make the fool confused

God bless my way everyday

Please turn me loose, I say come turn me loose

Real talk man a use, speaking up the truth make the fool confused

God bless my way everyday

Please turn me loose, I say come turn me loose
