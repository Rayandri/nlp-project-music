Last night pon my corner 
a brother came for a vision 
crying over me about the insane
do we go suffer till we done
we never know untill the right time a come
what's a real real purpose of our birth

life is a thing you should never underrate

cause the insane is a kind a curse

this a hopeful world that we living in

with love deh pon your side there is no giving in

they could never kill the answer

love is a reason fi stand for 

hopeful world that we living in

with god deh pon your side there is no giving in 

the wise man answer

love is the reason fi stand for

remember life is a one way

and something sent you down deh

reconnect yourself with a mystic all around

cause who a shine could change what the wrong say

we are alive to be alive we go suffer 

but god plants them ah on yah

and who a hear the melody will get back the answer

this is a hopeful world that we living in

with love deh pon your side there is no giving in

they could never kill the answer

love is a reason fi stand for 

hopeful world that we living in

with god deh pon your side there is no giving in 

the wise man answer

love is the reason fi stand for

a who nah real sleep regular

a who a deep trip sometimes

a kiss alone can't keep me on

falling in her shy eyes while she gamble on the stars line

cause we nah dabble

we never try no road

if each step you a take is the mirror of your soul then you gonna be the corner stone

who start with a lot inna the belly

will soon fall when the belly must run

you should put faith in the road man a walking

cause the road you a walking is the only one you belong 

is the only one you belong

this is a hopeful world that we living in

with love deh pon your side there is no giving in

they could never kill the answer

love is the reason fi stand for

hopeful world that we living in

with love deh pon your side there is no giving in

the wise man answer

love is the reason fi stand for

i am a warrior

are you a warrior ?

i am a warrior 

are you a warrior too ? 

i am a warrior

last night pon my corner 

a brother came for a vision 

crying over bout the insane

do we go suffer till we done

we never know untill the right time a come

what's a real real purpose of our birth

life is a thing you shoulda never underrate

love will make the last one first
