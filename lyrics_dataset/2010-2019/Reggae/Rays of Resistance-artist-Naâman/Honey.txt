Scene is a June night, flooded with moonlight
Fragrant roses in bloom

Garden bench with just room for two
You are the she-ro, I am the he-ro
Love is prompting the play

Here's the cue where I say to you

I'm in love with you, Honey

Say you love me too, Honey

No one else will do, Honey,

Seems funny but it's true

Loved you from the start, Honey

Bless your little heart, Honey

Ev-ry day would be so sunny,

Honey with you.

One thing is certain, second at curtain

Shows a wedding in June,

And a sweet honeymoon for two

With your permission, no intermission

There's so much in my heart

And so much to impart to you.

I'm in love with you, Honey

Say you love me too, Honey

No one else will do, Honey,

Seems funny but it's true

Loved you from the start, Honey

Bless your little heart, Honey

Ev-ry day would be so sunny,

Honey with you.
