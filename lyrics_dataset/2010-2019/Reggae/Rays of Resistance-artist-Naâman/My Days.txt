I'll suits on a bummer tour
Couple of things I can't ignore
Am I wise or am I just a fool
Strangers're passing by
Say hello, eye to eye
Do they think the same things as I do

I wanna escape with this behind

now chase the world up to the sky

It'll take me to the time of my days

I don't feel that I need to stay

I dreamed in a different kind of way

Try to see the world through their eyes

Please forgive me I am apologize

I truly just don't see the reasons why



Me seen in white and black

face to face but back to back,

There is a shadow everywhere I go

I'm facing down to the street

chasing by them on feet

Is there one place only I will know

I wanna escape with this behind

now chase the world up to the sky

It'll take me to the time of my days

I don't feel that I need to stay

I dreamed in a different kind of way



Try to see the world through their eyes



Please forgive me I am apologize



I truly just don't see the reasons why



(wuh ah why, wuh ah oh)

It'll take me to the time of my days

I don't feel the need to stay

I dreamed in a different kind of way

Try to see the world through their eyes

Please forgive me I am apologize

I truly just don't see the reasons

So just take me to the time of my days

I don't feel the need to stay

I dreamed a different kind of way

Try to see the world through their eyes

Please forgive me I am apologize

I truly just don't see the reasons why
