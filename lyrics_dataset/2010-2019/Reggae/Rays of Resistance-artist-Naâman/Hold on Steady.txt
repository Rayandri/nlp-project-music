Hold on steady, nah let it dreaded than dread
afi get ready fi make it greater than great

I wish i could sing my songs till the rest of my days
till I can't stop from make it blaze
let go me doubt man a leg go away me troubles

let go me fears

Free up the space let the love be a part of your breath

A lion nah run no race

Hold on steady, nah let it dreaded than dread

afi get ready fi make it greater than great

Every every every single little day

man afi fight a way, fi reach out deh

mi never cry mi never bawl you never see me stray

because the lion in my heart keep mi stronger everyday I'm

telling you

keep me away from them things material

reggae music is rebel anytime, honorable no matter what

Hold on steady, nah let it dreaded than dread

afi get ready fi make it greater than great
