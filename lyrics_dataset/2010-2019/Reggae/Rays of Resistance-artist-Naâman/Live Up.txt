sunshine came through every corner, peeking through the
shades
it doesn't have to fade, no nothing has to change
so i can go to sleep, finally

and i, i know nothing about the past

all i know is that it's passed

so i can't blame you for that

and you, you're sleeping in my bed

and you've lied to me again

i can smell it on your breath



so live up to the name you've been making for yourself

i know it can be hell, but you need to think about your

health

and you know we haven't spoken since christmas eve

but out of the gifts under the tree

your voice was the best that i'd received

i just miss you more that i ever cared to explain

or admit to your face, before you'd gone away



you, all you left me was your blood

when you showed me what you've done

in a desperate search for love

and i, i know nothing about the past

all i know is that it's passed

and it's never coming back

so we can go to sleep, finally
