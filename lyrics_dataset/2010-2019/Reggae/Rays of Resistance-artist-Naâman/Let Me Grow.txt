Give me the food and let me grow
give me the knowledge let me know
I'm like the early early sunshine
ready to enlight my people with something bright
give me the shoes and let me go
fi buy a ticket fi take the road

nah let me poor child walking on the moon side with nothing

oh did you hear my Oh Why when mi looking so high behind the

curtain

everything you love ago build up my pride

mi don't wanna miss any piece of your line

so nah leave me lone

please nah keep me down

and so long the pickney nah row

him go dance in the wind at the bow

so keep him dancing

keep your children learning



I see so many youths watch dem deh pon the road

with no place fi run they got no place fi go

maddest dreams dem a gone

and we a know we gonna bring back so faith in the man of

tomorrow

and Fatbabs said yes

InI spread out the way fi progress

fi the little youth we affi give them the best

we affi give them the best place

cause we are the future my brothers, my sisters

we are the future
