Won't you share a moment
Let's move under the moon until the shore
Here we are
Your soul has no secret
When I drown inna your eyes until the core

I feel your soul

I feel your soul

I feel your soul

I feel

Let the real love flow

Like we never did before

Can't hide it anymore

Eyes in the sky watching over us I'm sure

I know this sensation yes I got it

Glimpses of faces from past lives and different ages

I feel your soul

I feel your soul

I feel your soul

I feel

I know all about you

Everything you went through

Souls always talk true

Everything it says give me like a feeling

I found you walking down your avenue

Oh God knows how much I'm loving you

And I see thousand colors and a million flows

Mixing together when our bodies get close

I see in you the revelation of our destiny

Blood in our veins witness an epiphany

Inna your eyes just arise a new vision

Where the jungle just a dance with the ocean

You make me shy so me rock it easy

But you came along and rock it with me

Rock me nice kiss me darling

Open your arms let me fall in

I won't lie, how could I

What's got to be just got to be

Give a little more patience to it

And soon our seed gonna become tree

Won't you believe it

Remember oh I'm standing

And waiting for your love

I feel your soul

I feel your soul

I feel your soul

I feel
