Windmill, Windmill for the land. Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all it on your stride
It is taking, falling down
Love forever love is free
Let's turn forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land

Is everybody in?

Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats

Lining them up-a like ass cracks

Lay these ponies at the track

Its my chocolate attack.

Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here

Care bear bumping in the heart of this here

Watch me as I gravitate

Ha ha ha

Yo, we gone ghost town

This motown

With yo sound

You in the blink

You gonna bite the dust

Can't fight with us

With yo sound

You kill the INC.

So don't stop, get it, get it

Until you're Jet Ahead.

Yo, watch the way I navigate

Ha ha ha

Feel good

Feel good

Feel good

Feel good baby

Feel good

Feel good

Feel good

Don't stop, get it, get it

We are your captains in it

Steady

Watch me navigate

Ha ha ha

Don't stop, get it, get it

We are your captains in it

Steady, watch me navigate

Ha ha ha
