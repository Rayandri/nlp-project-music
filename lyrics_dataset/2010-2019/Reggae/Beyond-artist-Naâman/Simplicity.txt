Working hard under the sun from morning
but when my time comes I run kiss my darling
what a joy to go rest under the rays
I'm going on and on to do so
let the thing start pon a roof top
hold the vibe plug a mic let the loop talk

we got the trees them burning like at Woodstock

we are just fine living life as if it would stop



Me nah go wait till the end of my days

to melt in the waves of creation

I don't believe in this God that they pray

material things not my religion



Watch me on the way out

cause I got so much fi let go

this system blow my ego

it would work even if I'm gone

so maybe give me some time

give me some time, some time

just enough for me fi get by



Simplicity not inferior

my brother life could be easier

if we just let it go reconnect simple joys

that ah gwaan around the corner

cause none of we no need no captivity

we no need no captivity for sure

all we need is a deep integrity

to carry love everywhere we go now

many people sell out a life fi get rich

but still them feel so poor

no badda try ah take it away from me

cause I need it more and more





Watch me on the way out

cause I got so much fi let go

this system blow my ego

so I'm gone

some time

give me some time, some time

just enough for me to get by

oh some time

give me some time

some time just enough for me



A free ride is a good ride

starting it from nowhere it ah end up worldwide

everywhere I go I feel the presence of my old tribe

watching over me every time I let my soul fly

we getting so high and that is alright

me just ah love how you shine inna my blue sky

in my blue eye yes me blue eye

without your smile inside it would be so sad



Inna the morning me go rock it and sway

and melt into the waves of the ocean

I don't believe in this God that you pray

material things not my religion



Watch me on the way out

cause I got so much fi let go

this system blow my ego

I'm gone

some time

give some time, some time

just enough for me to get by

oh some time

give me some time

some time just enough for me
