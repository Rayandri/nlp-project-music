The feeling when you've met the right one
The one that you really conceived to
It is then your whole life just flow together
The mind has found the right place

For the one who really loves the whole me

Can see what a mess I can be

And will realize how hard I can be to deal with

But want after all this keep have me in his life



It have past some years since the day when you asked me

You have been my reason to continue to look forward to

tomorrow

To-o-mo-o-o-oo-o-row



Every time you look at me

I see something beautiful in your eyes

I wonder what that look means sometimes

But I don't have to know



It may be a mystery to me

While it's a matter of course (for you)



I look at you with happiness and with the still amazing

feeling

That you chose me

You'll probably see something in me that no one else sees

Not even myself

No one else see it

I don't know what it is



For the one who really loves the whole me

Can see what a mess I can be

And will realize how hard I can be to deal with

But want after all this keep have me in his life



It have past some years since the day when you asked me

You have been my reason to continue to look forward to

tomorrow

To-o-mo-o-o-oo-o-row
