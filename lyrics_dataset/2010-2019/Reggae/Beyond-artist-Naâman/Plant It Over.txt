They say I’m guilty
Consequence of their wicked plans
But father God knows I am free
And I will never bend down for some wicked men 
They’re selling out the country
They’re selling out the motherland

The more they use police brutality

Is the more we gonna fight down their government

Them ah try to concrete we over

But we go dig them down

Plant a whole heap a trees over

Them a try to concrete we over

But we go dig them down

Plant a whole heap a trees over

We gonna dig those cops haffi dig them

we gonna dig those cops haffi dig them

Ah me say who ah ever cheat upon the weak them

We gonna make sure nobody gonna try fi do it again ah me say

dig Those cops haffi dig them

Ah me say who ah grab up on our rights and rip them ah me

say love And harmony fi all the people them

Will never come itself if justice is dead

Six a.m. see dem again

Babylon leggo dem dogs fi wipe out my land

They got the money and the law

But they cant wash my brain

Cause I’m stepping in the right and that is all I aim

I say God will always hear the righteous

And listen to the voice of the dreamer

I stand for love so Father bless my home

Him stand inna me garden with a couple of stones so

What’s got to be we nah go pretend

Set the people free as it was written

If you want me to leave we gonna defend

we gonna defend

Them ah try to concrete we over

But we go dig them down

Plant a whole heap a trees over

Them a try to concrete we over

But we go dig them down

Plant it over

Tell me what it means to look for solutions

If we don’t use it

Tell me what it means to grow the love

If we let them keep on breaking it

All we need is love and faith in each others

Until we get it they’ll be coming in

They will be coming in

cause all of them are criminals

and what they do is illegal

situation critical, they try fi trick invisible

but none of we nah give it up we nah go stay miserable

We gonna dig those cops haffi dig them

We gonna dig those cops haffi dig them

Ah me say who ah ever cheat upon the weak them 

We gonna make sure nobody gonna try fi do it again

Ah me say dig those cops haffi dig them

Ah me say who ah grab up on our rights and rip them

Cause we say love and harmony fi all the people them

Will never come itself if justice is dead

Dig a dem down
