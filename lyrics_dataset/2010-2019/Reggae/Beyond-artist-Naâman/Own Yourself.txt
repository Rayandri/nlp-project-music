Upon your face I can see your smile
But inside it's a mess
Maybe the love you're looking for so long
is stuck in your heart deep down inside your chest
Who's gonna save your soul
By telling you the truth that you did know

Everything happen for a reason

If you stay blind to the cause you'll never learn and grow

Go on, go where you think is the right way

What you don't have for yourself you won't have for nobody

So listen, got to know what is love

What inside reflects the light from above

And if it's raggy, walking get you closer

Ain't no lucky men, only struggles that give us gain for

some pain

Love could be painful without it all we have

Is tears to shade

Is tears to shade

How can you love me, if you don't love yourself

Love is not to be put on a shelf

Can't own me, so own yourself

How can you love me, if you don't

Love yourself love is not to be put on a shelf

Can't own me, so own yourself

You rip me out, as every time I see you doubt

You rip me out where's your love gone

Only your heart will see beyond the flesh

So it alone can outline the purpose

Give strength to the faithless


Take it as he gave it

Throw down your arms

Can you feel the harmony

When we are the one where the one is just so many

But you rip me out

How can you love me, if you don't love yourself

Love is not to be put on a shelf

Can't own me, so own yourself

How can you love me if you don't love yourself

Love is not to be put down deh

Can't own me so own yourself

Ton visage s'habille d'un sourire

Auquel manque le coeur

Ce que tu cherches depuis toutes ces années

Est profondément enfoui à l'intérieur

Qui pourra sauver ton âme

Te rappeler ce que t'as oublié

Chaque jour a sa leçon

Et qui tourne le dos y laissera la raison

Et qui tourne le dos y laissera la raison

How can you love me, if you don't love yourself

Love is not to be put on a shelf

Can't own me, so own yourself

How can you love me, if you don't love yourself

Love is not to be put on a shelf

Can't own me, so own yourself

Own yourself

Can't own me, so own yourself
