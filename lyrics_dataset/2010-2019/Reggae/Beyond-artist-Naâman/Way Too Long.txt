You're standing by my side but somehow I miss you
Where is the laughing that we use to share
Where's the love and the smile that makes you you
Got to tell you just how much I care cause
It used to be a pretty someone
Seated tight right back on my pillion

Singing songs outta road to the neighbours

Said no one nah go live forever

Bring back your loving I say

Bring back the reason of my pride

Oh yes the reason of my pride

We wont be wasting egos

If we put them aside just for a while

It's been way too long

Give me back your smile and I give you back mine

It's been way too long

It's been way too long my baby

I said way too long

If I wouldn't love I wouldn't care but

it's been way too long

Too long we've been fighting for the cover

Stealing up warmth from each other

But only together we'll recover

We will find our way before it's over yes

One thing I got to mention

Growing the love brings ascension so

Water life when the dry days are rising

and love will beâ€¦ oh

Won't you open up the way show me a sign fi make me say

(I need you)

Only a smile from you today and our troubles fade away

It's been way too long

Give me back your smile and I give you back mine

It's been way too long

It's been way too long my baby

I said way too long

If I wouldn't love I wouldn't care but

It's been way too long

Be like the reed when the wind blow

Rest your head upon my pillow

Watch the storm by the window and

Cherish the love until tomorrow

One more thing I got to mention

Growing the love brings ascension

It's been way too long

Give me back your smile and I give you back mine

It's been way too long

It's been way too long my baby

I said way too long

If I wouldn't love I wouldn't care but

It's been way too long
