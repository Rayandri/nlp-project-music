Carry on, carry on
They say they know that world and every corner
But they can't know themselves
My brother don't get trap by their manners
And the words they say

They say they'll chase out war from your borders

But war is in themselves

Water we should not beg to the fire starter

No my friend, no my friend



If you wanna live a life where love is allowed

Jump over the trap them ah go put on your road

Only we alone gonna save our souls

I'm begging you carry on and on brothers

You carry on and on sisters



Give me back the reins of my life I'm gonna make it

We don't need no politicians that waffle in the pit

Everyone together we got all the solutions so please



Let's not press the detonator

Good people will make it better

Let's stick to the roots of mother nature

So change the rules and fuck the ruler





Let's do it, we go do it, we go do it

I see this time coming

Do it we go do it we go do it

I see this time coming

Do it we go do it we go do it

I see this time coming



If you wanna live a life where love is allowed

Jump over the trap them ah go put on your road

Only we alone gonna save our souls

I'm begging you carry on and on brothers

You carry on and on sisters



They would like to see the people fighting again

In the name of nationalism, oh god knows

But I know you didn't forget your past I say

Wake up humanism wake up humanism



If you wanna live a life where love is allowed

Jump over the trap them ah go put on your road

Only we alone gonna save our souls

I'm begging you carry on and on brothers

You carry on and on sisters
