So amazing she
Got some sort of a spell on me
And all I can do is seem to please
I do anything she ask of me (ask of me)
Ooh, you are making me believe that your my, your my girl
It's something I've been looking for in my, in my world

Do everything to my my lady, and I'm, and I'm yours

and I'm, and I'm yours

And I gotta let you know that

(Reff)

When I'm around you (I never grow cold)

And what we got girl (It never grow old)

And just like a music (With every note, every note, every note)

Every time you leave me (Me wanting more)

And what you give me (It never get bored)

Coz what we got girl (It never grow old, never grow, never grow, never grow old)

Turn it up (turn it up)

You set my soul on fire

Turn it up (turn it up)

My knees are getting lighter

Turn it up (turn it up)

And we said that we are a lover

Baby you, you make me fall in love with you

But there's something I gotta know

How far are you willing to go

Ooh, you are making me believe that your my, your my girl

It's something I've been looking for in my, in my world

Do everything to my my lady, and I'm, and I'm yours

and I'm, and I'm yours

And I gotta let you know that
