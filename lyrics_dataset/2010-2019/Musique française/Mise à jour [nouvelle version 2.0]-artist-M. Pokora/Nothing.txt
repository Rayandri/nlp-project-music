Pictured my love in this frame for you baby
Its like a bird that never learns to fly
My shattered heart is in pieces for you baby
Im uncompleted I need you here by my side
Baby Im sorry sometimes I get so insecure
Every second Im thinking about you

Over and over and over again, yeah

and now you know ..

(Reffrain)

That without you Im nothing, nothing

I shoulda never ever let you go, ooh

Im nothing, nothing, oo, o-ooh

coz I cant live without you, ooh (8x)

To get you back, it's a mountain to climb

I cant win, Im losing my mind

Dont say I run out of time

Please girl, dont say goodbye

Believe Im gonn lost my mind

Im going insane

Standing here calling out your name

Over and over and over again, yeah

Now I know ...
