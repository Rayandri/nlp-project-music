Refrain:
Hey girl you dont understand what you mean to me
Do anything not to lose ya
I take you to the top of the world
Hey girl, my heart's lost when you're not close to me
Keep praying for the chance to feel ya

I take you to the top of the world



To give my best, coz you're my everything

the only on my mind

I gotta tell you your everything I want, yeah

Gotta feel so good, to let you in my world

And I can say that is, is incredible you everything I want



Hook:

Baby think about you all the time

and lose control of myself

coz you dont know what you have done to me

Baby, when I get you close to me

and hold my hands and my body

I kiss you then I turn off the lights



I told you that if you give me the keys to your heart and let me in

I give you the world my love

coz that is what you deserve, yeah

and nothing that I won't do

just go and give me the world

and you know that I will be there

'til the end of time

you're everything that I want



(hook)
