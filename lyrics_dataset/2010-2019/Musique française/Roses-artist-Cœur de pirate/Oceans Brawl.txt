Brought a knife to hell and saw
What was left down there and more
Hide-and-seeked for far too long
Kept my treasures with my bones
Lived for lies, lived for tales

Lived for good and hit the rails

Love you, boy, with what I know

Kept my love up with my bones



Brought a knife to hell and saw

What was left down there and more

Hide-and-seeked for far too long

Kept my treasures with my bones



Lived for lies, lived for tales

Lived for good and hit the rails

Want you, boy, with what I know

Kept my love up with my bones



Found the fire in the rain

Burning drops drowned all my pain

Listen to the ocean's brawl

I'll find you and then I'll crawl



Pierced your arrow through my heart

Wanted me, now want me gone

In your hiding, you're alone

Kept your treasures with my bones



Told me lies, told me tales

Lived for bad and hit the rails

Hate you, boy, with what I know

Kept my love up with my bones



Found the fire in the rain

Burning drops drowned all my pain

Listen to the ocean's brawl

I'll find you 

And then I'll crawl (x4)



Brought a knife to hell and saw

What was left down there and more

Hide-and-seeked for far too long

Kept my treasures with my bones



Lived for lies, lived for tales

Lived for good and hit the rails

Hate you, boy, with what I know

Kept my love up with my bones
