All streams lie below the sea
That's what's been told, that's why we're free
And careless we are when we are young
And all we could do was live through songs
And you came running to my life
Your laugh laced with gold and still gray eyes

Your voice left echoes in my mind

Were you someday to be mine?



And I'll find my way back home

Just to read upon the light that's in your eyes

And if you ever feel alone

Just remember that I'll be coming back



And in these waters where we lay

The currents are strong, we're washed away

We're looking, we look for different hearts

Once they are found, we keep them crossed



And I'll find my way back home

Just to read upon the light that's in your eyes

And if you ever feel alone

Just remember that I'll be coming back

And I'll find my way back home

Just to read upon the light that's in your eyes

And if you ever feel alone

Just remember that I'll be coming back
