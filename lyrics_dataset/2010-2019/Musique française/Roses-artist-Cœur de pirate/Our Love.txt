I hear the sea, it roars
Into my secret hell
You're screaming at the door
And I can hardly yell
And times are hard, I'm longing to see
A different view where you're longing for me

I hear the sea, it roars

And I want out of here



Our love remains a breaking wave

Nothing's left but the sand

Our love remains a race to the end

Nothing's left but the lies



I hear your song, it calls

But you were never there

All that I know is gone

And I can live again

And times are hard, I'm longing to see

A different view, are you longing for me?

I hear your song, it roars

And I want out of here



Our love remains a breaking wave

Nothing's left but the sand

Our love remains a race to the end

Nothing's left but the lies



I hear the sea, it roars

Into my secret hell

You're screaming at the door

And I can hardly yell
