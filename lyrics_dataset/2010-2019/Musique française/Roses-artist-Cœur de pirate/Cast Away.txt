Cast away the shadows of your heart
If you're always aiming for a better part
In this play that punctuates your life, your goals
You think you know, you're down below
And you've kept your distances from me
Carried on with all your fears that set you free

But at night you change into the darkest swan

With all its fears, you've come undone



And I don't know if you've been hurt before

And all the scars you bare are from a previous war

But if it's fear of love that keeps you out of open arms

Then I will leave the lights on any trail to come

And you will find your way in any given storm



I remember walking you to hell

When you asked the man for one last mission bell

And I followed until the darkness came

I felt so lost, you were my cause

So I'll ask again and again

Why the courage left when you numbed the pain

Was I ever part of what you called your plan?

I felt so lost that I left your cause



And I don't know if you've been hurt before

And all the scars you bare are from a previous war

But if it's fear of love that keeps you out of open arms

Then I will leave the lights on any trail to come

And you will find your way in any given storm [x2]
