Those street lights are changing as new waves of sorrow enter the night
And concrete walls can sing all of the times we raged in fright
Can you face the facts or are you ignoring what we've become?
And I'll walk in silence until I have found what needs to be done
But I don't want to break your heart

It's hard enough that we're apart

All I can say is your name

What we had could not be tamed

And we can fight all we want

The sun is setting on our love

And I can't take another lie

So for now, I'll say goodbye

I'll say goodbye



I can recall all of the times that I've waited for you

Just give me a sign that you want to hear what we are going through

And those walls keep our secrets and they're ignoring what we've become

Just walk out in silence I think we've found what needs to be done



But I don't want to break your heart

It's hard enough that we're apart

All I can say is your name

What we had could not be tamed

And we can fight all we want

The sun is setting on our love

And I can't take another lie

So for now, I'll say goodbye

I'll say goodbye



I told my bae it's her life

And she the freshest for getting me

Told her goodbye, because this ride could get dirty, yea

I couldn't lie I keep my message like 3rd degree

Burn you inside, ain't wanna fire my lady, yea

Wait till I'm 88 then I'll have the key

Thinkin' back on my shorty, and realize it's for me

I leave the date then I radiate, I'm young and I'm free

Thinkin' back can't be sorry, I love you best when I leave

Aw, boo



But I don't want to break your heart

It's hard enough that we're apart

All I can say is your name

What we had could not be tamed

And we can fight all we want

The sun is setting on our love

And I can't take another lie

So for nowÂ…



But I don't want to break your heart

It's hard enough that we're apart

All I can say is your name

What we had could not be tamed

And we can fight all we want

The sun is setting on our love

And I can't take another lie

So for now, I'll say goodbye

I'll say goodbye

Just say goodbye

Oh, just say goodbye
