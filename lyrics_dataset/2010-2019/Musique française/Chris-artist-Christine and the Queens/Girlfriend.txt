Chris
I'm gone in a flick, but back in a second
With salted skin, rash for no reason
Boys are loading their arms, girls gasp with envy
F-f-for whom are they mimicking endlessly?

Same old sadness in small lumps on my jaw

For lusting after is the usual freak show

May your girl come, birdie die under this spur

F-f-fingers angrily sunk on the jugular



Girlfriend

Don't feel like a girlfriend

But lover

Damn, I'd be your lover



Girlfriend

Don't feel like a girlfriend

But lover

Damn, I'd be your lover



Yes sir, I am wet, for I abandoned my fame in the lake

Let's see now how fast you're breathing and how long this will all take

Those who used to pass by me think they are baffling a liar

F-f-fuck is you? You don't even taste much better!

Came back steaming in sweats in the morning

I muscled in for I wanted to hold him

Then shriveled to let those bird-dogs rage through

F-f-f is me? F-f-fuck is you? F-f-fuck is you now



[Christine and the Queens & DâM-FunK:]

Girlfriend

Don't feel like a girlfriend

But lover

Damn, I'd be your lover



Girlfriend

Don't feel like a girlfriend

But lover

Damn, I'd be your lover



Chris, I don't know why you trippin'



Touché, touché, touché, touché...

Touché, touché, touché, touché...

Touché, touché, touché, touché...

(You got to keep on rollin' girl)

(Keep rollin', rollin')

Touché, touché, touché, touché... (B-b-b-baby)

Touché, touché, touché, touché... (B-b-b-baby)

Touché, touché, touché, touché... (B-b-b-baby)

Touché, touché, touché, touché... (Oh no)

Touché, touché, touché, touché...



Yeah
