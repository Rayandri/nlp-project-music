I'm lingering on when they kiss
Leaning towards this abyss
And of lately the only people I can stare
Are the unraveled ones with their hands laying bare
But their hands are numb and empty
Their dull silence soothes me

Loud whispers in my back as if I couldn't hear

Thought I left ghosts behind but they're just coming near



It doesn't matter, does it

If I know any exit

If I believe in god and if god does exist



Rage as a fabric, through and through

Like that gaze used to do

'Cause those suicidal thoughts that are still in my head

Gives her that awful side-smile when I lay in bed



It doesn't matter, does it

If I know any exit

If I believe in god and if god does exist



She's barely feeding, but she'll deny

Ribbon-legged, she passes by

Until she surrenders in the midst of the street

And the guys simply stare but continue to eat



It doesn't matter, does it

If I know any exit

If I believe in god and if god does exist



And if I'm cast out 'cause I wanted some more

And if this guy dances too close to the shore

And if I could just push this door chalked on the wall

And if after the void there's somewhere else to fall



Forget I said it

I soliloquize

It's stinging nettle

Their hands on their thighs



Run if you stole a shard of sunlight

Don't ever tell them, I've got your back

Choking to tears with shards of sunlight

Run if you stole a shard of sunlight



Save all you can

You won't be found

And never come back !
