I am out, for a walk
And I will not be back until they're staining my skin
This is how I chose to talk with some violent hits
Violent blossoms akin
Every night I do walk, and if there, looking down not referring my chin
This is how I chose to talk with some violent hits

Violent blossoms akin



That's a way to truly be seen

By furiously scheming in

Forget the jewels

I'm livid, friends are shutting out

Fine on their own

Blood on my cheeks, birds come by

One of my stomps and they fly

People politely smile to make sure I wonâ€™t come any closer



I am out, for a walk

And I will not be back until they're staining my skin

This is how I chose to talk with some violent hits

Violent blossoms akin

Every night I do walk, and if there, looking down not referring my chin

This is how I chose to talk with some violent hits

Violent blossoms akin



Now

A swollen eye is for days

Of curious calm, snow in May

Way better off on my own

Since no one cries there's no one to blame

It hurts, I feel everything

As my sense of self's wearing thin

Such pains can be a delight

Far from when I could drown in my shame



I am out, for a walk

And I will not be back until they're staining my skin

This is how I chose to talk with some violent hits

Violent blossoms akin

Every night I do walk, and if there, looking down not referring my chin

This is how I chose to talk with some violent hits

Violent blossoms akin
