Temperature is high
I got a fever burning hotter than the sunlight
Everybody, leave
There's no grantee
So I promised myself that would never happen to me

No matter what I say or do

It's always wrong

It's always wrong

I know I can't give you what you want

Give you what you want



I got two left feet

I got two left feet

In love, in love

I got two left feet

I got two left feet

In love, in love

So just let me dance

So just let me dance

So just let me dance

No love

So just let me dance

So just let me dance

So just let me dance

No love



I won't feel a thing

When it comes to

I got a thousand scars

So I'll keep on dancing here with a broken heart



No matter what I say or do

It's always wrong

It's always wrong

I know I can't give you what you want

Give you what you want



I got two left feet

I got two left feet

In love, in love

I got two left feet

I got two left feet

In love, in love

So just let me dance

So just let me dance

So just let me dance

No love

So just let me dance

So just let me dance

So just let me dance

No love



I got two left feet

I got two left feet

In love, in love

I got two left feet

I got two left feet

In love, in love

So just let me dance

So just let me dance

So just let me dance

No love

So just let me dance

So just let me dance

So just let me dance

No love
