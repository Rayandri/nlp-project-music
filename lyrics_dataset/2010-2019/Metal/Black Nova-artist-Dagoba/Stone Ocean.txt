What seemed to be lake
A frightening sea
Abyssal chaos?
No heart beats
Swimming against the stream

That brings you back to nothing

Life taken away

All feelings die in the gray



Liquid turns to stone

Drowned in cement

Everything's gone

Life around you closed its gate



Blood in solid state

Nothing moves on the scene anymore

Frozen river

(Frozen river)

Silent waves

Stone ocean you're diving in

(You're diving in)



What seemed to be a lake

The darkest sea

Abyssal chaos

Your heart still beats



Liquid turns to stone

Drowned in cement

Everything's gone

Life around you closed its gate



Blood in solid state

Nothingâ€¦
