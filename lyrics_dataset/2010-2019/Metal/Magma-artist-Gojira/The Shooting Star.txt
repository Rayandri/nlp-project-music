On the first light of the day you march on
Departure has arrived, don't look back
Avoid the darkness stay away, stay out of sight
Until you've filled the last of shooting star
Following the sparklight "" in the sky

Between the bear and the scorpion getting close

"" frozen land where tiger go to die

Don't fear the cold and "" memories out

You are "", in the sky

learn the skill to stay alive, survival

sitting "" you beeing watch

reach the dawn of light, the torture of the heart

until the light calls you back into the wild

whene you get to the other side please send a sign

...

and if you hold the truth within your hand

...
