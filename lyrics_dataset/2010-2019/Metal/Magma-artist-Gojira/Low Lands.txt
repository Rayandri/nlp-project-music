Tell me what you see
In the afterlife
Par-delà le ciel
Par-delà le soleil
In all there is to learn

The sun is on our side

And though you're on the run

You will survive



Expanded to the state of light

The deepest corners of the world

Gliding through the low lands

And swimming all the oceans



Walking through the silence

Already made it through the night

There will be a new day

Whenever the sun rises



You're invisible

You're in everything

Tell me what you see

Tell me what you see

When you're everywhere

When you're everywhere

Tell me now

Tell me now



While you drift away from all the plates of this world

You're put out of misery

Giant bones hurt

You won't have to face it again

Every step of the way gets you higher



All the voices trapped underneath the ground

Let them all go in the sky

Find the power lost underneath the ground

Let it all blow in the sky



All the voices trapped in my head

Let them all scream in the night

Find the power lost underneath the ground

Let it all blow in the sky
