I wrote a song, a Shiza Song
On radio, I wanna go
I WANT IT ALL, AROUND THE WORLD
Cada stereo for my bongo
I made a song, a shiza song, on radio, I wanna go

I wanna sing, mi crappy swing on shiza tunes of idiots

Letseugo on radio



I want the TV, I wanna rock

I want the girl who want the singa suck

A private party, so I can shine

I want Fergie to sing into my mic



Tokyo city, Angola, Cuba, Dolce cabanna

Bigga NY City, Barcelona Miami

China, Inglaterra, Vatican o Panama

From Gaza, Gaya to Neptune, play my funky tune



I made a song, a shiza song, on radio, I wanna go

I wanna sing, mi crappy swing on shiza tunes of idiots

I wanna please stunning MCs

Numero UNO, I wanna go

Hit the radio with my bongo

Ho gimme joba-jobi-blow you funckin loser operator



Fuck you operator, you gonna sucka sucka mé

You stuck in the transistor, you're playing suga suga babe

oh suga baaaabe



Tell me something I don't know

Solo gimme gimme some



(Merci à Babou xD pour cettes paroles)
