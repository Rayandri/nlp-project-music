We all have a soul plan
While stepping on a coal ground yes
Knowing all is open
May help you cool down
Backward is a dead end

Forward everyone ah go

Don’t fear no time cause

Time nah gonna stop from flow

Born and raised upon Jah land

Everybody got chosen

Walk the talk that’s all we got

Walk the talk my friend



I know we are walking on a rocky road

And some of us do carry heavy loads

See river dry even when overflowing

No bother tell me we are left alone

Finally bright as the sun

When the watеr get blurry

Just let it settlе down

Finally bright as the sun

Soul plan



We all have a soul plan

While stepping on this coal ground yes

Knowing all is open

May help you cool down



Say I gotta cool down



The original frequency

Perfect love in a melody

Primal memory

Be who you wanna be



Life is but a bridge must a cross it

No man a gonna build up a house upon it

Man a come with a bundle of assets

Karmically must empty your basket

Life is but a wave must a ride it

No fi be afraid must a face it

Hold stance and a keeping a balance

Careful nah fi fall ina violence

Man a hold the pace

Conscious keep a smile upon me face

Lightning and a thunder pon da place

Still I rise and praise Jah for the grace

Man chant for we life a not a race

Put faith and love deh pon your case

All man inna end a reach da base

Soul forever blaze

Life forever bless



For we all have a soul

Deh pon a rocky road

All have a goal

Cosmically play a role

All is a code

Like a rhythm and a note

Open the case

Keep up the pace

Open the gates, embrace



We all have a soul plan

While stepping on this coal ground yes

Knowing all is open

May help you cool down
