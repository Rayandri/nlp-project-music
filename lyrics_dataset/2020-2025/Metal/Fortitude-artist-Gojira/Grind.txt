Surrender to the grind
Embrace the laws that make you cringe
You will be fixed in no time
If you go all the way
Grind

Grind



We're wandering in chaos

Forget about which reality is real

Eternal quest to resolve

Our struggle with gravity



Youâ€™re all shredded, you're all scarred

Fighting the tide

Your tough face on, you think you'll last long

Against the grain?



Go

Surrender to the grind

Obey

Surrender to the grind



The only way

Grind

Grind
