Mortal, spawn on the altar
Caught in the heart of the blaze
The primal fear of disappearing
Becoming
A ghost in the void

Death



Give a price, put a name

None of it real in this matter

Wandering, distracting

Wishing the life of another

Self



We were born for one thing

Tame the greatest fear of all



We were born for one thing

Born to face the greatest fear of all



We're all drawn into ourselves

In a collective coma



Remember, gazing up for answers

But now we're staring down



Down

Down

Down



All is blur in the maze, we put an end to all



We were born for one thing

Tame the greatest fear of all



We were born for one thing

Born to face the greatest fear of all



We're no one

United

When we're gone
