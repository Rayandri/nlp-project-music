All that you see that is gold is truly gold
I spotted through the vines, a deer in the wild
Signs in the trails
Beyond the reason

Eye-gazing the unknown, defeating the ground

This passage through the flames, leads me where the souls go

Signs in the dreams

Beyond the reason

We're forced into the light

How can we be so blind?

Our light is torn

How can we be so lame?

No truth being told

Signs in the trails

Beyond the reason

All that you see that lives truly is alive

Let us stay awake reminded of the trails that matter
