I've been grinding and grinding
Oh, ocean have mercy
I've been grinding and grinding
Oh, ocean have mercy
I give you my life

Oh, son of the sun



I've been rowing and rowing

No sign of land so far in the flood

I've been through fire and wind

I'm hanging, feet in the depth



Drowning all day long

In an ocean of stress

Gotta find a safety raft

Another wave is striking down



Hold on, fight

We are merely grabbing on to

Hold on, fight

Unconscious ride around the core



In a matter of time, you're out in the open

You shall prove yourself in the bitter end

But for now, brace yourself

Hold on, fight

We are merely grabbing on to

Hold on, fight

Unconscious ride around the core



When you witness death you understand your demise

And you may embrace your destiny, the fate of all

And maybe when we die we rise high, find a ground

And we return where we belong



Elders, deep under

Shelter, land



Fight

We are merely grabbing on to life

Fight

One last attempt to break the code



Hold on, fight

We are merely grabbing on to

Hold on, fight

Unconscious ride around the core



Hold on, fight

Hold on tight

Hold on, fight

Hold on tight
