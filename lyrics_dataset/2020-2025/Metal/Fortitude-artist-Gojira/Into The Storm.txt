Go
Say something about awakening
The rebellion you felt before
Wake, change your course
Laws will follow

Restart, reactivate the core

Rise

Yeah you come out

You're awake now

Put your fist in the air

You were hiding

Now you throw yourself

Into the storm

Stand

Gather your strength, raise your eyes

Fear not the demons you're up against

Now that you dove down

Found the bottom begging for air

How sad, how long it takes us to rise and fight

Yeah you come out

You're awake now

Put your fist in the air

You were hiding

Now you throw yourself

Into the storm

Flames

Dancing in the open

You step into the light

You step into the light

Now that you dove down

Found the bottom begging for air

How sad, how long it takes us to rise and fight

Yeah you come out

You're awake now

Put your fist in the air

You were hiding

Now you throw yourself

Into the storm

Storm

Into the storm

Storm
