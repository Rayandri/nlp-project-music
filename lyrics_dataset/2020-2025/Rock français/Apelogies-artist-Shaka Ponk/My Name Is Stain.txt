I'm Stain, my name is Stain
I don't complain, I won't complain
Do you comprend' what is the point of being born and being gone there must be a reason
War to the east, Pain to the west
War is at least, What we do 'best

What we do best is sharing guns

and kill for fun there must be a reason

My name is Stain I guess my dad he had the sens of humour

He gamme such a name cause stains they all mix together

If you are red or blue you depend on the trends

but stains is no problem : everywhere you find them

The guy next door, is such a whore

the food I eat is poison or

I eat no food cause I can't find a store

Ma mama says I must be a tough guy, to live out there

I wanna know why ma mama says you got to be bad or beware

oh Mam'

I no more share your point of view

I know that bros are not so cruel

They're not so bad, but just afraid

The best to do is to give some comprend'

I'm Stain

My name is Stain

So don't complain

And take my hand, you take my hand

So world it needs to shine again

My little friend we've got to start again

and to give some comprend'
