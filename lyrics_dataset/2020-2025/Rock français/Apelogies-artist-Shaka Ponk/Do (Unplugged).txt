I chase Down the empty street 
Is my step the last living beat ? 
This beat ? i feel so deep 
Slowly dies into ... what da hell did you Do ? 
Hey mama tell me please 

Why is dady workin' ? So much, so hard, so late 

Erasing families ? 

Is my kids fate : smokin' grass and wait ? 

Break it Down this wall on silence 

I believe in us so give your kids a chance 

What are you gonna Do ? 

Don't give it up in da name of lifa, 

I believe in us so give your kids a chance 

What are you gonna Do ? 

She told me to give respect 'cause I'm too young 

To give my point of view 

There must be some mistake 

'Cause nothing's green and blue, what da hell 

Did they Do ? 

What Don't you confess dady ? 

Why Don't you cry into my arms for good 

I need you, you need me 

Let's be a family and fix the world like we should.
