I believed in my girl
But when she walked out the door
My c√¥re began to render
Just a lot o' mo than befo'
I gave it all, she took it all
No matter what I say...

Well the girls work in mysterious ways



I believe in myself

Now, that's all that I've got

I m a voluntary man born to work a lot

I gave them all, my body and soul, so many nights and days

Well the biz works in mysterious ways



I will keep on strugeling on and on with life 'till I'm alive and to the bitter end

I will keep on strugeling on and on with life 'till I'm alive and to the bitter end

The end...



I believe in my friends

I'd do anything

Anyrthing for them, for me they'd do the same

We swore a lot, shared a lot confianza and betrayal

Well my friends work in mysterious ways



I will keep on strugeling hard in vain, ' till I fall down again

I will keep on strugeling hard in vain, ' till I fall down again



4 - I believe in my lord

When he wispers in my chords

Don't look around, don't look behind, you're building your own maze (he says)

Well my God works in mysterious ways

Come on, love love love love



I will keep on strugeling hard in vain, ' till I fall in love again

I will keep on strugeling hard in vain, ' till I fall in love again



I'm strugeling hard until I... love again
