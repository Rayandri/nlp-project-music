I ran an endless race
To leave the land I know
Sometimes I feel so restless
Some things I'll never show
But you held my hand
Through the wind, our cold

And if there's a fight, you said

I won't face it alone



And undone is what I am

You won't ever see me through

But as I stand tall with you, I know

That I'll be whole again

You'll make me whole again



You carried all my fears

You let my demons play

And constant lights are cast upon

Our path to better days

So in sickness and thunder

You'll stay by my side

And if our bones must shudder

We'll find peace of mind



And undone is what I am

You won't ever see me through

But as I stand tall with you, I know

That I'll be whole again

You'll make me whole



And I tried and I tried to rest our fears where we lay

But the lights and the fights we hold they could leave us astray

And just try to leave me, love me, love me as I am

But we try, can we not do this in vain?



And undone is what I am

You won't ever see me through

But as I stand tall with you, I know

That I'll be whole again



And undone is what I am

You won't ever see me through

But as I stand tall with you, I know

That I'll be whole again

You'll make me whole again [x2]
