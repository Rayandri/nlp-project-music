Tasting the mint and tasting the whiskey
I'm Phil√©as
Smog I'm killing the fog
With my nose and the nose of
the longboard
Two glasses on the back of my board

The

first one in mint the other one in whiskey

Tasting the mint

and tasting the whiskey

I let my tears and the rain making

a race

To fall into the back, back of my neck

I'm

alone like a dying horse and its eyes bleed

The first eye

in mint the other one in whiskey

Tasting the mint and

tasting the whiskey

For the longboard blues...

And I

love to roll through the streets full of birds

And I steal

the pigeon wings

I'm a bird, I'm a board,

I'm flying horse

Tasting the mint and tasting the

whiskey
