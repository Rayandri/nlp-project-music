Ring, ring, Betty's singing, Calvin's hooked up in
Baked beans she loves cooking. Tiny woman lost in a big kitchen
Dream, dream, Betty's yawning -Air conditioned- doesn't work in.
So long, she's been sleeping. Don't know the baked beans are burning 
Don't know Calvin's blazing. So that the big kitchen
Betty, your house is burning. Sweetie, a little bit of your money's leaving

Some heights, south west Brooklyn, some heights, south west Brooklyn
