I met you, it was night
Got you thru' the jungle, right 
Was it you ? Was it me ?
Was it just me falling in love with you ? 
I'm a cutie, so pretty broke lover ha ha
Burn a hole in my pocket, baby

Put a kiss in, put a spell

You love me as you can

But our love is just a flash in the pan

I'm a cutie, so pretty broke lover ha ha

Twist me around your little finger

Just like money smiled to me 

Now I'm down on my knees 

Baby sold me down the river

Here I'm broke as an old dead tree

I'm a cutie, so pretty broke lover ha ha

Wish I had insured the tears

I wasted for you

Wish I had insured each and every tear

I left you

I'm a cutie, so pretty broke lover ha ha

Baby did me dirt
