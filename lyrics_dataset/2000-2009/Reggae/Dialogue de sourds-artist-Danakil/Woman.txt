Woman in this world, I need your love x2
I meet you at the Green Park
In front of my square
Shining on the deep dark
That was always been there



Woman now I know you

I do declare

There is no more room to take in my heart



Refrain :

Come, come, write your name on those happy days

Oh please, come, follow my way

x2



Woman , I want your love

Woman, I need it to leave now

Another day is gone

And I would never be alone

Open up your heart Celine

Now you are mine

It's easy for you as for the yellow to shine



I used to sing that song but It was so empty now

My dream will be carried out

I'm gonna rock it with you now



Refrain x2



Instru..



Refrain x2

Oh Celine, come come come, follow my way



Come, come, come...
