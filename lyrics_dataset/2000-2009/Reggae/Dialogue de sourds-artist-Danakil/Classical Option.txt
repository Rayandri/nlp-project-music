This is my Classical option 
the one that i choose for every mission 
And this is my classical vision 
The face of an angel with the heart of a lion 
And who's my classical champion 
Number one called Danakil sound

You got to live how you need to live 

and you need to live how you want to live 

Girl you got a problem now 

We listen and we over stand 

But you know my only doctrine 

Is to hear musical medecine 

Live the way you like 

You like it hot so take it hot 

You like it clean well make it clean 



This is my Classical option 

the one that i choose for every mission 

And this is my classical vision 

The face of an angel with the heart of a lion 

And who's my classical champion 

Number one called Danakil sound 

Classical champion

They come to judge you don't care about them 

Show the world how you're open minded 

To rise with our ladies and babies 

We got to cure world from its diseases 

There's a lot of work to do
