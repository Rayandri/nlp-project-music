Four hundred thousand years ago 
They came from outer space 
And gave us life here 
We are taking everything for granted 
I don't think we should do this now 
And when I see the smoke all around 

I feel like I'm not 

From humankind down there 

I feel like glaciers are my eyes 

And mountains are my head 

My heart is ocean 

And I feel all alone 

Because everybody's wrong 

I feel the living 

What is this thing that we call hate 

And that's inside of me 

Get out of here! 

A world is down 

And none can rebuild it 

Disabled lands are evolving 

My eyes are shut, a vision is dying 

My head explodes 

And I fall in disgrace 

I hold my inner child within 

And tell him not to cry 

?Don't fear the living? 

One day you will stand as a king 

And no fear can erase 

This light below us 

Each one of us is now engaged 

This secret we all have 

This truth is growing 

And as a warrior I have to fight 

I can already feel 

The love I'll discover 

I had this dream, our planet surviving 

The guiding stars always growing 

And all the worlds 

The fates all the countries 

They're all rebuilding at the same time 

I never fell and always believed in 

We could evolve and get older 

Open your eyes and let all this flow 

Now see a new hope is growing inside 

We will see our children growing
