You have to write this! 
you will look so!
You have to practice!
Never let yourself go!
But are you ready? 
It's not a new!

Before i watching, 

what the shave in the noon?



I just wanna be free.

c'est la vie!



You have to break eye,

buy me a drink,

from there your seem eyes, 

i don't care what you think!

if feel something,

but let it show,

before i watching really get her on the floor!



I just wanna be free.

c'est la vie!



You have to write this! 

you will look so!

You have to practice!

Never let yourself go!

If you get something 

Don't let it show!

Before i watching, 

Realy get her on the floor!



I just wanna be free.

c'est la vie!



Be like this, don't do that!

don't gone too far,

give me a big smile,

if she drive a better car!!

don't give me distance,

you talk too much!

Before I'll watching what you thing 'bout us...



I just wanna be free.

I just wanna be free

c'est la vie!
