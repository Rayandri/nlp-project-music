I spent so much enery
I keep falling down my knees, baby
I spent so much energy
But the call is not for me, I'm down
Try to show her a different men

But her reaction is the same

I spent so much energy

But she keeps rejecting me



Aaaaaaaaha rejection

Aaaaaaaaha possession



I spent so much energy

On the frantic rivery

I should start on my grace

She blew smock in my face

Can't you see ther's nothing more about me, baby

Now it's time to seek and try to find a way

X2

Aaaaaaaaaaha rejection

Before you turn your back on me I wanna get my energy
