I can't stand the people after me
Don't want anymore jealousy
They pretend to be my friend
They say this for ever
Al they set to give their hand
Any brand new commer



Ahaaa! They wanna put me down

Ahaaa! They let me hit the ground



Someone said that I like gamble

Mister, I don''t wanna [***]

Controversy in my head

They don''t seem to understand

I can''t feel my [***]

Don''t have time for paddy man



Ahaaa! Somebody set me free

Ahaaa! I''m tired of your sympathy

Ahaaa! Jealousy!



Don''t tell me I''m weaping out for you

Seem to me that your around or two

I don''t wanna argue look

You think I''m out my head

I guess I should thank you look

For the moment, I feel bad



Ahaa! You Wanna put me down

Ahaa! [***]



You tell me that that I had my time

Left the golden ages behind

I am ready to take it easy

Even if your talking vain

I don''t wanna hear you baby

Bang bang here I come again



Ahaaa! Somebody set me free

Ahaaa! I''m tired of your sympathy



Ahaaa! Jealousy!



Let''s make a brand new start

Open up your mind

Get rid of some of this this jealousy

It''s [***] in me

For al this jealousy!



Somebody help me!

Somebody! Somebody! Somebody!

Stop this jealousy!

Ahaaa! Jealousy!
