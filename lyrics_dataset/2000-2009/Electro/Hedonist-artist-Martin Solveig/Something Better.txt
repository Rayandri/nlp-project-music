Ooh, my darling, I'm thinking
About how my life has changed me
Yeah you are passion, sensation
I feel like I'm a different man now
Ooh, so strong, for too long

I've been searching for a girl like you

Change it all

'Cause since I found you really made it better

{2X}

I ___ of something better

I dreamed of something better

I found something better

You're something better for me

Something better

Yes something better for me

Now, I'm caught up, so tight up

But don't be a player baby

I can wait for more, more action

I'm checking your reaction

('Cause I wanna do it and I want you to be happy with it)

I don't care, sounds fair

To ___more reality

'Cause you change it all

'Cause since I found you really made it better

{2X}

I ___ of something better (you made it better)

I dreamed of something better (you made it better)

I found something better

You're something better for me (hey)

{3X}

Darling I've been waiting all my life

And I'm so glad that I found you

You and I can make it without a doubt

I'm so thankful for having you

You're something better for me

'Cause I ___ for something better

'Cause I dreamed of something better

You're something better for me

I ___ for something better

I've dreamed of something better

You're something better for me

I found something better than you

You're something better for me...
