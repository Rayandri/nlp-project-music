Now as the wheel of life turns faster
Now as the seasons seem to fly
I see so many things at last, but didn't see the time go by
I've known delight, I've known disaster
The caviar, the humble pie

From the absurd to the sublime

I didn't see the time go by



I didn't see the years roll on

I didn't know the road would bend

Refused to see when youth was gone

Pretending it might never end

Now, there is price to pay for every day I threw away



It seems I've wasted half a lifetime

Within the blinking of an eye

I didn't hear the midnight chime

I didn't see the time go by



In stolen nights and brief romances

I kissed the girls and made them cry

While there were balconies to climb

I didn't see the time go by



I was the guy with all the answers

The halfway-truths, the little lies

So sure, so certain in my prime

I didn't see the time go by



I hit the heights, I bit the dirt

I left some wreckage in my way

I didn't see that lies can hurt

I didn't know how hearts can break

And now, they come to haunt my mind

The lives I touched and left behind



I've sung a hundred songs of longing

Of sweet regret and hope run dry

I've searched for melody and rhyme

But never saw how time can fly

Newer saw the darkening sky



I was a minstrel of my time

Who did not see the time go by
