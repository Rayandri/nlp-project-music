all streams lie below the sea thate whate been told thate why we re free and careless we are when we are young and all we could do was live through songs and you came running to my life your laugh laced with gold and still gray eyes your voice left echoes in my mind were you someday to be mine and i ll find my way back home just to read upon the light thate in your eyes and if you ever feel alone just remember that i ll be coming back and in these waters where we lay the currents are strong we re washed away we re looking we look for different hearts once they are found we keep them crossed and i ll find my way back home just to read upon the light thate in your eyes and if you ever feel alone just remember that i ll be coming back and i ll find my way back home just to read upon the light thate in your eyes and if you ever feel alone just remember that i ll be coming back
