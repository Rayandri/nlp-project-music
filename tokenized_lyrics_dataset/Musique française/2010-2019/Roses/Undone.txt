i ran an endless race to leave the land i know sometimes i feel so restless some things i ll never show but you held my hand through the wind our cold and if there a fight you said i wone face it alone and undone is what i am you wone ever see through but i stand tall with you i know that i ll be whole again you ll make whole again you carried all my fears you let my demons play and constant lights are cast upon our path to better days so in sickness and thunder you ll stay by my side and if our bones must shudder we ll find peace of mind and undone is what i am you wone ever see through but i stand tall with you i know that i ll be whole again you ll make whole and i tried and i tried to rest our fears where we lay but the lights and the fights we hold they could leave us astray and just try to leave love love i am but we try can we not do this in vain and undone is what i am you wone ever see through but i stand tall with you i know that i ll be whole again and undone is what i am you wone ever see through but i stand tall with you i know that i ll be whole again you ll make whole again x2
