i lingering when they kiss leaning towards this abyss and of lately the only people i can stare are the unraveled ones with their hands laying bare but their hands are numb and empty their dull silence soothes loud whispers in my back if i couldne hear thought i left ghosts behind but they re just coming near it doesne matter does it if i know any exit if i believe in god and if god does exist rage a fabric through and through like that gaze used to do cause those suicidal thoughts that are still in my head gives her that awful side-smile when i lay in bed it doesne matter does it if i know any exit if i believe in god and if god does exist she barely feeding but she ll deny ribbon-legged she passes by until she surrenders in the midst of the street and the guys simply stare but continue to eat it doesne matter does it if i know any exit if i believe in god and if god does exist and if i cast out cause i wanted some more and if this guy dances too close to the shore and if i could just push this door chalked the wall and if after the void there somewhere else to fall forget i said it i soliloquize ite stinging nettle their hands their thighs run if you stole a shard of sunlight done ever tell them i ve got your back choking to tears with shards of sunlight run if you stole a shard of sunlight save all you can you wone be found and never come back
