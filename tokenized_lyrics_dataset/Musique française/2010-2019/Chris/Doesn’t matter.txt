i lingering when they kiss leaning towards this abyss and of lately the only people can stare are unraveled ones with their hands laying bare but numb empty dull silence soothes loud whispers in my back if couldne hear thought left ghosts behind re just coming near it doesne matter does know any exit believe god exist rage a fabric through like that gaze used to do cause those suicidal thoughts still head gives her awful side-smile lay bed she barely feeding ll deny ribbon-legged passes by until surrenders midst street guys simply continue eat cast out wanted some more guy dances too close shore could push door chalked wall after void there somewhere else fall forget said soliloquize ite stinging nettle thighs run you stole shard sunlight done ever tell them ve got your choking tears shards save all wone be found never come
