tasting the mint and tasting the whiskey i phil√©as smog i killing the fog with my nose and the nose of the longboard two glasses the back of my board the first one in mint the other one in whiskey tasting the mint and tasting the whiskey i let my tears and the rain making a race to fall into the back back of my neck i alone like a dying horse and its eyes bleed the first eye in mint the other one in whiskey tasting the mint and tasting the whiskey for the longboard blues ... and i love to roll through the streets full of birds and i steal the pigeon wings i a bird i a board i flying horse tasting the mint and tasting the whiskey
